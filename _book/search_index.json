Air pollution terminology generally breaks matter down into two phases, particulate and gas. - Particulates and aerosols are generally synonymous terms in air pollution literature, i.e. liquid and solid phase. They are distinguished from gases and vapors. Thermodynamic systems are classified into two major types: closed and open. A closed system does not allow material to enter or leave the system (refer to “control mass”); a open system allows material to enter and leave the systems (known as “control volume”). Another thermodynamic concept is that of the “property”. An intensive property is independent of the system’s mass (such as pressure and temperature). An extensive property is proportional to the mass of the system (such as density or volume). Dividing the value of an extensive property by the system’s mass gives a “specific property”, such as specific heat, specific volume, or specific gravity. The thermodynamic term for the description of the change of a system from one stage (e.g. equilibrium) to another is known as a “process”. 描述系统从一个阶段（例如平衡）到另一个阶段的变化的热力学术语被称为”过程”。 Processes may be reversible or irreversible; they may be adiabatic (no gain or loss of heat, so all energy transfers occur through work interactions) or non-adiabatic (will be introduced in the following chapters). 过程可能是可逆的或不可逆的；它们可能是绝热的（没有热量的得失，因此所有能量传递都是通过工作相互作用发生的）或非绝热的（将在以下章节中介绍）。 Other processes include isometric (constant volume), isothermal (constant temperature), isobaric (constant pressure), isentropic (constant entropy), and isenthalpic (constant enthalpy). 其他的过程包括等距（恒定体积）、等温（恒温）、等压（恒压）、等熵（恒熵）、等高温（恒移差）。 Phases partitioning means the substance will exist in one or more physical phases. An important partitioning coefficient for air pollution is Henry’s Law, which states that the partial pressure of a compound can be related to its equilibrium concentration in a dilute aqueous solution through a constant of proportionality. 阶段划分意味着物质将存在于一个或多个物理阶段。空气污染的一个重要分配系数是亨利定律，该定律指出，化合物的分压可以通过比例常数与其在稀水溶液中的平衡浓度有关。 \\(e^p = e^{kc}\\) e ≈2.71828; p:溶液上的氣體分壓(partial pressure) C: 溶液體積莫耳濃度; k: Henry constant (因溶劑和溫度的不同而感變) A varying number of molecules will find their way into the air, even though most of the molecules remain in the water, i.e. dissolved in water. Even a small amount of partitioning can account for large amounts of vapor phase compounds in the atmosphere. 不同数量的分子会找到进入空气的途径，即使大部分分子留在水中，即溶解在水中。即使是少量的分隔也可以解释大气中大量的气相化合物。 The predominant vapor in the air is, not surprisingly, water vapor. 空气中的主要蒸气是水蒸气，这并不奇怪。 In the atmosphere, above their temperature of condensation, vapor molecules act just like permanent gas molecules in the air; below its condensation temperature, if the air is saturated, water changes from vapor to liquid. 在大气中，在其冷凝温度之上，蒸气分子的作用就像空气中的永久性气体分子；低于其冷凝温度，如果空气饱和，水从蒸气变为液体。 This phenomenon gives rise to fog or mist in the air and condensed liquid water on cool surfaces exposed to air. 这种现象在空气中产生雾或雾，在暴露于空气的凉爽表面上凝结液态水。 Gaseous composition in Tables 1.1 is expressed as parts per million by volume - ppm (vol.) or ppmV. 單位很重要！！！ 濃度轉換 &gt; To convert from units of ppm (vol.) to µg m-3 , it is assumed that the ideal gas law is accurate under ambient conditions. A generalized formula for the conversion at 25 °C and 760 mmHg is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{1ppm(vol.) pollutant} &amp;=\\mathrm{\\frac{1l pollutant}{10^6 1 air}}\\\\ &amp;=\\mathrm{\\frac{(1l/22.4)\\times MW \\times 10^6 \\mu g }{}} \\end{aligned}\\] Where MW equals molecular weight (g mol-1). For convenience, conversion units for common pollutants are shown in Table 1.3 (next slide) More than 90% of the degradation of methane is by oxidation, mainly by reactions with the hydroxyl radical in the stratosphere which accounts for more than 90% of methane loss. The equilibria and fate of CO2, CH4, and other carbon compounds are discussed in detail in the following chapters. Essential compounds include micronutrients needed by plant life and other organisms in the ecosystems. However, even essential substances can become pollutants in the wrong concentrations. Thus, expression of chemical concentration is crucial to understanding atmospheric science generally and the fundamentals of air pollution specifically. "],["課間.html", "Chapter 2 課間", " Chapter 2 課間 2.0.1 Chemical Concentration Atmospheric concentrations can be expressed as combinations of mass and volume, usually volume per volume or mass per volume. 大气浓度可以表示为质量和体积的组合，通常是体积/体积或质量/体积。 The higher the vapor pressure of a substance, the more of the molecules of that substance finds its way to the atmosphere. This exchange among solid, liquid, and gas phases, including vaporization, is discussed in detail in the following chapters. 物质的蒸气压越高，该物质进入大气的分子越多。以下各章将详细讨论固体、液体和气体相之间的这种交换，包括汽化。 Atmospheric concentrations can be both spatial and temporal variability, such as the differences in ambient concentrations in various urban areas and seasonal differences in the same urban area. 大气浓度可以是空间和时间上的变异性，例如不同城市地区的环境浓度差异和同一城市地区的季节差异。 Although the total amount of substances under the category “organic vapors” is somewhat constant on a global atmospheric scale, it is highly variable in the ambient air (e.g. much higher concentrations near a wood processing facility) and even more variable between ambient and indoor air, as indicated in Table 1.5. 尽管”有机蒸气”类别下的物质总量在全球大气尺度上有些恒定，但在环境空气中变化很大（例如木材加工设施附近的浓度高得多），在环境空气和室内空气之间变化更大，如表1.5所示。 The variability in chemical concentrations can be even greater among various types of indoor environments. 各类室内环境中化学浓度的变化可能更大。 The concentration of an air pollutant that is expected and permitted will vary according to the protection needed in ambient air and various personal and workplace microenvironments 预期和允许的空气污染物浓度将根据环境空气以及各种个人和工作场所微环境所需的保护而变化 2.0.2 Atmospheric Fluid Properties The term “fluid” includes all liquids and gases. A liquid is a form of matter that is composed of molecules that move freely among themselves without separating from each other. A gas is a form of matter that is composed of molecules that move freely and are infinitely able to occupy the space in which they are contained at a constant temperature. The medium itself, gases like carbon monoxide, vapors like benzene, and liquid aerosols. Water is a key fluid, such as its vapor phase (e.g. clouds, fog, and steam) and its liquid phase (e.g. droplets, surface and groundwater interactions with the atmosphere). “流体”一词包括所有液体和气体。 液体是物质的一种形式，由在彼此之间自由移动而不相互分离的分子组成。 气体是物质的一种形式，由自由移动的分子组成，并无限能够在恒温下占据它们所包含的空间。 介质本身，气体如一氧化碳，蒸气如苯，液态气溶胶。 水是一种关键流体，如蒸气相（例如云、雾和蒸汽）及其液相（例如液滴、地表和地下水与大气的相互作用）。 It is a common practice to add concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide in ppm (vol.) and express the sum as “oxides of nitrogen”. In metric units, conversion from ppm (vol.) to µg m-3 must be calculated separately for nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide prior to addition. 在ppm（vol.）中添加二氧化氮和一氧化氮浓度，并将和表示为”氮氧化物”是一种常见的做法。在公制单位中，从ppm（vol.）转换为µg m-3必须在添加之前分别计算二氧化氮和一氧化氮。 Density is a very important fluid property for any air pollution situation. If a pollutant is very dense, such as a heavy particle, it will stay aloft for a much shorter time and distance than will a lighter particle of the same shape and size. 2.0.3 The Science of Air Pollution- Air Pollution in perspective Biologists may think of how contaminants in the air affect living things. Ecologists are often interested in how exposures to air pollutants affect biodiversity and overall ecosystem health. Biomedical scientists are concerned about the diseases associated with various air contaminants. Toxicologists, in particular, are interested in how these effects differ from one species to another and from one type of contaminant to another. It is not unusual for a compound to be acutely toxic at low doses for fish, but acutely toxic in mammals only at much higher doses. 生物学家可能会想到空气中的污染物如何影响生物。 生态学家常常对空气污染物的暴露如何影响生物多样性和整体生态系统健康感兴趣。 生物医学科学家关注与各种空气污染物相关的疾病。 毒理学家尤其对这些影响在不同物种之间以及从一种污染物到另一种污染物之间有何不同感兴趣。 一种化合物在低剂量时对鱼类剧毒的情况并不罕见，但在哺乳动物中剧毒的情况仅在高剂量时才是如此。 Biological specialists have myriad concerns about air pollution, such as geneticists’ interest in how pollutants may change genetic material in organisms or how genetically modified organisms may be transported into the atmosphere and potentially reach human populations and ecosystems. Epidemiologists are interested in how the exposure and effects of air pollutants differ in time and space. Chemists are often concerned about the various types of pollutants. For example, they may be interested in how reactive or persistent certain compounds are after they are released from a stack, vent, or tailpipe. How the compounds change after release, i.e. what reactions occur in the atmosphere after release. 生物专家对空气污染有许多关切，例如遗传学家对污染物如何改变生物中的遗传物质或转基因生物如何被运输到大气中并可能到达人类人口和生态系统的兴趣。 流行病学家对空气污染物的暴露和影响在时间和空间上有何不同感兴趣。 化学家经常关注各类污染物。例如，它们可能对某些化合物从堆栈、通风口或排气管释放后的反应性或持久性有兴趣。 化合物释放后如何变化，即释放后大气中发生什么反应。 This is also the concern of physicists, who want to explain the thermodynamics and motion that is involved in this transfer and the fate of air pollutants as they are created and after they are released. People living near an industrial complex likely will see frequent, visible signs of pollution, such as dark plumes emitted from smoke stacks or hazy conditions on certain days. A person with asthma may be more concerned about certain air pollutants than those who have never experienced breathing problems. Students who have taken a few earth science or meteorology courses, hopefully, will be more aware of even subtle forms of pollution than are lesser informed people. 这也是物理学家关注的问题，他们想解释这种转移所涉及的热力学和运动，以及空气污染物产生时和释放后的命运。 居住在工业园区附近的人们可能会看到频繁而明显的污染迹象，如烟囱发出的深色羽毛或某些日子的朦胧状况。 哮喘患者可能比从未经历过呼吸问题的人更关心某些空气污染物。 参加过几门地球科学或气象学课程的学生，希望会比了解情况较少的人更了解甚至微妙的污染形式。 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines air pollution as the presence of contaminants or pollutant substances in the air that interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects. Most pollutants cannot be sufficiently and accurately detected solely by the five human senses. Many are odorless, colorless, and otherwise undetectable. Even those that are inherently detectable with unaided human senses, such as hydrogen sulfide’s (H2S) rotten egg odor or orange color of lead oxide (PbO), are sensed only at concentrations well above thresholds of harm. “What you don’t know won’t harm you” is not true for most air pollutants. 美国环境保护署（EPA）将空气污染定义为空气中存在干扰人类健康或福利，或产生其他有害环境影响的污染物或污染物物质。 大多数污染物不能仅靠人类的五种感官就能得到充分和准确的检测。许多是无味、无色的，否则是无法检测到的。 即使是那些固有地可以用人类独立感官检测到的物质，例如硫化氢（H2S）腐烂的蛋味或橙色的氧化铅（PbO），也只能在远远高于危害阈值的浓度下被感知到。 “你不知道的不会伤害你”对于大多数空气污染物来说都不是真的。 2.0.4 The Science of Air Pollution- Emergence of Air Pollution, Engineering, and Technology Environmental awareness is certainly more “mainstream” and less a polarizing issue than it was in the 1970s, when key legislation reflected the new environmental ethos. The 1970 Clean Air Act codified the national need to decrease air pollution by requiring federal standards for ambient air quality. Not only are the environmental disciplines young, but also many of the environmental problems faced today differ from those throughout most of human history. 2.0.5 The Science of Air Pollution- What is Air Pollution When does science consider the atmosphere to be unpolluted versus polluted? To compare the condition of the atmosphere currently against some type of baseline, e.g. pre-industrialized atmosphere prior to the nineteenth century. Another approach is to consider the principles by which materials are released into the atmosphere, move, transform, and are removed from the atmosphere, and based on this assessment determine the extent of atmospheric pollution. The same chemical compounds or particles from a natural source (e.g. a volcano) elicit the same adverse effects as when they are emitted by anthropogenic sources. Air pollution implies acceptability Air pollutants affect both human health and ecosystems. Approximately two million people in rural areas die each year from exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter (PM) suspended in the indoor air. Excess mortality due to outdoor PM and sulfur dioxide contribute to mortality of about 500,000 people annually. In the United States, the Clean Air Act of 1970 established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to address six so-called “criteria air pollutants”: particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and lead (Pb). The clearest association of toxic air pollutants in recent decades has been with cancer, although neurotoxicity (especially in children) from lead and mercury grew in importance in the 1970s and 1980s. By the end of the twentieth century, new toxic pollutants also competed for the public’s attention, including air pollutants that threaten hormonal systems in humans and wildlife, as well as those associated with immune system disorders. 2.0.5.1 Particulate Matter PM is always suspended in various concentrations in the troposphere. Particles are aggregates of many molecules, sometimes of similar molecules, often of dissimilar ones. They form and transform in the air by several processes. Some particles serve as nuclei upon which vapors condense. Some particles react chemically with atmospheric gases or vapors to form different compounds. When two particles collide in the air, they tend to adhere to each other because of attractive surface forces, thereby forming progressively larger and larger particles by agglomeration. 对流层中的PM总是以各种浓度悬浮。 粒子是许多分子的聚集体，有时是相似的分子，往往是不同的分子。它们通过几个过程在空中形成和转化。 一些粒子作为原子核,蒸气在其上凝结.一些粒子与大气气体或蒸气发生化学反应，形成不同的化合物。 当两个粒子在空气中碰撞时，由于有吸引力的表面力，它们倾向于相互粘附，从而通过聚集而逐渐形成越来越大的粒子。 The larger a particle becomes, the greater its weight and the greater its likelihood of falling to the ground (sedimentation) rather than remaining airborne. Washout of particles by snowflakes, rain, hail, sleet, mist, or fog is a common form of agglomeration and sedimentation. Other particles leave the air by impaction onto and retention by the solid surfaces of vegetation, soil, and buildings. The particulate matter in the atmosphere is dynamic - continual injection into the air from sources of small particles; creation of particles in the air by vapor condensation or chemical reaction among gases and vapors; and removal of particles from the air by agglomeration, sedimentation, or impaction. As mentioned earlier, the true natural background concentration will never be known. The best that can be done now is to assume that the particulate levels at remote places - the middle of the sea, the poles, and the mountaintops - approach the true background concentration. PM is a common physical classification of particles found in the air, such as dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. PM is not a specific chemical entity but is a mixture of particles from different sources and of different sizes, compositions, and properties. The chemical composition of PM is very important and highly variable, which can tell us much about its sources, e.g. receptor models use chemical composition and morphology of particles as a means to trace pollutants back to the source. PM是空气中常见的粒子物理分类，如尘埃、污垢、烟尘、烟雾和液滴。 PM不是一个特定的化学实体，而是来自不同来源和不同大小、组成和性质的粒子的溷合物。 PM的化学成分非常重要，变化很大，这可以很好地告诉我们它的来源，例如受体模型使用化学成分和颗粒形态作为追踪污染物回源的手段。 The chemical composition of tropospheric particles includes inorganic ions, metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and crustal substances (e.g. carbonates and compounds of alkali and rare earth elementals). Some atmospheric particles can be hygroscopic, i.e. they contain particle-bound water. The organic fraction can be particularly difficult to characterize, since it often contains thousands of organic compounds. Particles range from ultrafine to coarse; the size of a particle is determined by how the particle is formed. If particles are sufficiently small and of low mass, they can be suspended in the air for long periods of time. Sources of particles are highly variable. Particles may be emitted directly to the air from stationary sources, such as factories, power plants, and open burning, and from moving vehicles (known as “mobile sources”), first by direct emissions from internal combustion engines, but also when these and other particles are re-entrained due to the movement of vehicles (e.g. in a “near-road” situation) 如果粒子足够小，质量低，可以长时间悬浮在空气中。 粒子的来源变化很大。 颗粒可直接从固定源（如工厂、发电厂、露天燃烧）和移动车辆（称为”移动源”）排放到空气中，首先是由内燃机直接排放，但也可在这些颗粒和其他颗粒由于车辆移动而被重新夹带时（例如在”近距离”情况下） The volume (mass) distribution is called bimodal because of its separate maxima at about 0.2 and 10 µm, which result from different mechanisms of particle formation. The mode with the 0.2-µm maximum results from coagulation and condensation formation mechanisms. They are called fine particles to differentiate them from the particles in the 10-µm maximum mode, which are called coarse. These fine particles are primarily sulfates, nitrates, organics, ammonium, and lead compounds. 体积（质量）分布被称为双峰，因为它在约0.2和10 µm处分离的最大值，这是由不同的粒子形成机制所产生的。 最大为0.2 µm的模式是由凝结和凝结形成机制所产生的。它们被称为细粒子，以区别于10-µm最大模式下的粒子，称为粗粒子。 这些细颗粒主要是硫酸盐、硝酸盐、有机物、铵和铅化合物。 The mode with the 10-µm maximum are particles introduced to the atmosphere as solids from the surface of the earth and the seas, plus particles from the coagulation-condensation mode which have grown larger and moved across the trough between the modes into the larger size mode. These are primarily silicon, iron, aluminum, sea salt, and plant particles. The majority of particles in the atmosphere are spherical in shape because they are formed by condensation or cooling processes or they contain core nuclei coated with liquid. Other important particle shapes exist in the atmosphere; e.g. asbestos is present as long fibers and fly ash can be irregular in shape. The amount of each element or radical, anion, or cation that is present in the mixture can be determined. Specific organic compounds may be separated and identified. The shapes of individual particles may be analyzed by electron microscopy. Particle size dictates the necessary control technologies, determines the types of health and environmental problems to be expected when particles are inhaled and retained by the human respiratory system and when particles absorb and scatter incoming solar radiation. 10 µm最大值的模式是作为固体从地球表面和海洋引入大气层的粒子，加上凝结-凝结模式的粒子，这些粒子已经变得更大，并且在模式之间跨槽移动到更大的尺寸模式。这些主要是硅、铁、铝、海盐和植物颗粒。 大气中的大部分粒子是球形的，因为它们是由冷凝或冷却过程形成的，或者含有涂有液体的核核。 大气中还存在其他重要的粒子形状；例如石棉存在于长纤维和粉煤灰可以是不规则的形状。 可以确定溷合物中存在的每个元素或自由基、阴离子或阳离子的量。 可以分离和鉴定特定的有机化合物。 单个粒子的形状可以用电子显微镜分析。 粒径决定了必要的控制技术，决定了人类呼吸系统吸入和保留粒子以及粒子吸收和散射进入的太阳辐射时预期的健康和环境问题类型。 2.0.6 The Science of Air Pollution- Atmospheric Transport and Fate Air pollutants are studied from at least three perspectives: the sources, the movement, and the receptors. The sources of air pollutants vary in size (e.g. tons emitted per year), type (e.g. stationary or mobile) and composition (e.g. coke oven emissions include thousands of compounds, but many smelters include a handful of metals). Movement can range from molecular diffusion to continental and global transport in winds aloft. Receptors include humans, ecosystems, and materials. 至少从三个角度研究空气污染物：来源、运动和受体。 空气污染物的来源在大小（例如每年排放的吨）、类型（例如固定式或移动式）和成分（例如焦炉排放物包括数千种化合物,但许多冶炼厂包括少量金属）方面各不相同。 运动范围从分子扩散到大风中的大陆和全球运输. 受体包括人类、生态系统和物质。 2.0.7 Sources and Sinks The places from which pollutants emanate are called sources. There are natural as well as anthropogenic sources of the particles and gases considered to be pollutants. Plant and animal respiration and the decay of what was once living matter; . Volcanoes and naturally caused forest fires are other natural sources. A special type of natural sources are biogenic, which are living things that release a variety of pollutants, both organic (e.g. volatiles like pinene) and inorganic (e.g. carbon dioxide [CO2] and methane [CH4]). 污染物产生的地方称为来源。 有被认为是污染物的颗粒和气体的自然和人为来源。 植物和动物的呼吸以及曾经生物的腐烂；火山和自然引起的森林火灾是其他自然来源。 一种特殊类型的自然来源是生物来源，它们是释放各种污染物的生物，包括有机污染物（例如，像松烯这样的挥发物）和无机污染物（例如，二氧化碳［CO2］和甲烷［CH4］）。 The places to which pollutants disappear from the air are called sinks. Sinks include the soil, vegetation, structures, and water bodies, particularly the oceans. The mechanisms whereby pollutants are removed from the atmosphere are called scavenging mechanisms. The measure used for the aging of a pollutant is its half-life - the time it takes for half of the quantity of a pollutant emanating from a source to disappear into its various sinks. Most pollutants have a rather short half-life (i.e. days rather than decades) that prevents their accumulation in the air to the extent that they substantially alter the composition of unpolluted air. 污染物从空气中消失的地方称为汇。 水槽包括土壤、植被、结构和水体，特别是海洋。 污染物从大气中清除的机制称为清除机制。 用于污染物老化的措施是其半衰期，即从一个源发出的污染物数量的一半消失到其各种汇中所需的时间。 大多数污染物的半衰期较短（即几天而不是几十年），可防止污染物在空气中积聚，从而大大改变未污染空气的成分。 Several gases do appear to be accumulating in the air to the extent that measurements have documented the increase in concentration from year to year. Such as CO2, nitrous oxide (N2O), CH4, CFCs, and other halocarbons. CFCs are chemically very stable compounds in the troposphere and have half-lives from tens of years to over hundreds of years. One of the sinks for CFCs is** transport to the stratosphere**, where shortwave UV radiation photo-dissociates the molecules, releasing chlorine (Cl) atoms. When in excess, these Cl atoms decrease the steady state stratospheric ozone concentration, in turn increasing the penetration of harmful UV radiation to the earth’s surface. 有几种气体似乎在空气中积累，其测量结果表明浓度逐年增加。如CO2、一氧化二氮（N2O）、CH4、CFC等卤代烃。 氟氯化碳是对流层中化学上非常稳定的化合物，半衰期从几十年到几百年。 氟氯化碳的一个汇是传输到平流层，在那里短波紫外线辐射将分子光解离，释放出氯（Cl）原子。当过量时，这些Cl原子降低稳态平流层臭氧浓度，进而增加有害紫外线辐射对地球表面的渗透。 Oxidation, either atmospheric or biological, is a prime removal mechanism for inorganic as well as organic gases. Inorganic gases, such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and sulfur trioxide (SO3), may eventually form corresponding acids: Oxidation of SO2 is slow in a mixture of pure gases, but the rate is increased by light, NO2, oxidants, and metallic oxides which act as catalysts for the reaction. The formed acids can react with PM or ammonia to form salts, such as sulphate and nitrate. 大气或生物氧化是无机和有机气体的主要去除机理。 无机气体，如一氧化氮（NO）、二氧化氮（NO2）、硫化氢（H2S）、二氧化硫（SO2）、三氧化硫（SO3），最终可能形成相应的酸： 在纯气体的溷合物中，SO2的氧化速度较慢，但其速率由光促進、NO2、氧化剂和作为反应催化剂的金属氧化物增加。 形成的酸可以与PM或氨反应生成盐，如硫酸盐和硝酸盐。 2.0.8 Receptors A receptor is something that is adversely affected by polluted air. A receptor may be a person or animal that breathes the air and whose health may be adversely affected thereby, or whose tissue may be irritated, or whose surfaces (e.g. skin, leaf cover, roof) may be coated or discolored. Some properties of the atmosphere itself, such as its ability to transmit radiant energy, may be affected. Aquatic life in lakes and some soils are adversely affected by acidification via acidic deposition. 2.0.9 Transport and Dispersion Transport is the mechanism that moves the pollution from a source to a receptor. The wind is the means by which the pollution is transported from the source to the receptor. During its transit over the 5 mile between the source and the receptor, the plume does not remain a cylindrical tube of pollution of the same diameter as the interior of the stack from which it was emitted. If the wind speed is greater than the speed of ejection from the stack, the wind will stretch out the plume until the plume speed equals wind speed. The sum of all these processes is called diffusion. Dispersion is the preferred term when discussing atmospheric transport at a scale larger than molecular. If the plume carrying air pollutants is above the height where ground-based convective and turbulent processes will bring it down to the ground reasonably close to its origin, it may travel for hundreds of miles at that height before being brought to earth by these processes in a remote community. This is known as** long-range or long-distance transport**. 2.0.10 Polluted Atmosphere The same chemical compounds or particles from a natural source (e.g. a volcano) elicit the same adverse effects as when they are emitted by anthropogenic sources. The source does not define air pollution. The receptor is a better reference point for determining whether air is polluted or unpolluted. (Examples). Unpolluted air is merely a benchmark to show the extent and trends of air pollution. Governments around the world have established and are continuously evaluating the impact of elevated levels of myriad gases and particulate material in the atmosphere. (Visibility, health, ecosystems, buildings and structures) 来自天然来源（如火山）的相同化合物或颗粒所产生的不利影响与来自人为来源的化学化合物或颗粒所产生的不利影响相同。 来源没有界定空气污染。该受体是确定空气是被污染还是未被污染的一个更好的参考点。（例子）。 未受污染的空气仅仅是表明空气污染程度和趋势的基准。世界各国政府已经建立并不断评估大气中无数气体和颗粒物含量升高的影响。（能见度、健康、生态系统、建筑物和构筑物） A substance is an air pollutant only in amounts which could be harmful to the health or comfort of humans and animals or which could cause damage to plants and materials”. When a substance is deemed to be an air pollutant, the governments are compelled to set standards and to require prevention, control, and other actions to decrease the pollution to a concentration considered acceptable. Air pollutants are a type of “contaminant”, which implies that something must be cleaned up. Contamination is also a term that is applied differently by scientists and the general public, as well as among scientists from different disciplines. 物质是一种空气污染物，其含量可能对人和动物的健康或舒适有害，或可能对植物和材料造成损害。” 当一种物质被视为空气污染物时，各国政府被迫制定标准，要求采取预防、控制和其他行动，将污染降低到被认为可以接受的浓度。 空气污染物是一种”污染物”，意味着必须清理一些东西。 污染也是科学家和公众以及来自不同学科的科学家以不同方式使用的术语。 Public health is usually the principal driver for assessing and controlling environmental contaminants, but ecosystems are also important receptors of contaminants (i.e. acid rain). Contaminants are not limited to abiotic chemical substances, but can be biological (viruses, molds, etc.) and physical, such as the energy from ultraviolet (UV) light. 公共卫生通常是评估和控制环境污染物的主要驱动力，但生态系统也是污染物（即酸雨）的重要受体。 污染物不限于非生物化学物质，而可以是生物（病毒、霉菌等）和物理的，例如来自紫外线（UV）光的能量。 "],["w02_0301.html", "Chapter 3 W02_0301 3.1 Air Pollution Decision Tools– Introduction 3.2 Air Pollution Decision Tools– Interpreting Data 3.3 Expressions of Air Pollution Risk 3.4 Causal Links between Risk Factors and Adverse Outcomes 3.5 Biologic Gradient 3.6 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Systems Context for Air Pollution 3.7 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Energy 3.8 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Energy Life Cycles 3.9 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Environmental Justice during Extraction 3.10 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Fuel Cycle Impacts 3.11 空氣污染氣象學", " Chapter 3 W02_0301 3.1 Air Pollution Decision Tools– Introduction Air pollution results from myriad sources and processes. This information must be evaluated and integrated to inform decision makers as to the best approaches for addressing the problems presented by polluted air. The information in the figure indicates that air pollution is not a single variable, linear relationship between sources and receptors. Indeed, activities that one may assume would increase emissions, such as increased energy consumption and vehicle miles travelled, were accompanied by substantial decreases in the emissions of criteria air pollutants. The relationships between risk from air pollutants and sources can only properly be explained systematically. That is, the harm that results from air pollution is a product of the life cycle of pollution. Air pollution is an outcome of the steps that involve energy and various types of matter, both living and non-living. The life cycle includes not only time in the air, but also time in the water, on the land, in the soil, and within organisms. The emission of an agent is only one part of the life cycle. Indeed, it is not even the beginning, since certain processes always precede the emission. environmental and health policies are made from two broad perspectives: evidence-based risk assessments. Precaution. For evidence-based decisions, the onus is mainly placed on proving that a product or process causes harm, whereas in precaution-based decision making, the onus is placed on proving something is safe or will not cause harm. The precaution usually includes an element of irreversibility, i.e. even a slight chance that an agent will cause irreversible harm would lead to a decision not to allow the agent, or at least only allow it at levels below which there is strong scientific information showing no harm. Both evidence-based and precaution-based decisions require the analysis of substantial amounts of data. Evidence-based risk assessments require information regarding both the hazard and the likelihood of exposure to that hazard. Thus, if this information is scarce or unreliable, the risk assessment is useless at best and dangerous at worst, since it either underestimates or overestimates the risk. For problems that may affect large numbers of people, large geographic areas, and/or that are irreversible, precaution is in order. This is the basis for factors of safety in engineering design and prudence. Therefore, precaution applies to global scale air pollution, such as the long-range transport of pollutants, acid rain, and climate change (Figure). One of the arguments for taking actions to address climate change is that climate change could be irreversible (given the long wait for sufficient evidence) and that under many predicted scenarios such change likely would lead to widespread and severe damage to public health and ecosystems. The ecological effects include loss of diversity and productivity. Some habitats are particularly vulnerable to irreversibility. The understanding of the factors that lead to a risk is called risk analysis; whereas the reduction of this risk (e.g. by wearing helmet and staying on bike paths) is known as risk management. Risk management, including the policies, laws, and other societal aspects of risk, is often differentiated from risk assessment, which comprises the scientific considerations of a risk. Air pollution risk is increased in two very basic ways. The mix of substances may become inherently more harmful; or the amount of exposure to harmful substances may increase. The former is an increase in the hazard and the latter is an increase in exposure. Air pollution actions must be based on reliable risk analysis and assessment. 3.2 Air Pollution Decision Tools– Interpreting Data Events can be characterized in a number of ways. Events may be discrete or continuous. Events can also be independent or dependent. Since air pollution usually involves numerous variables, joint probabilities are also calculated. For n mutually exclusive events as possible outcomes from E that have probabilities equal to P{Ei}, the probability of these events in a trial equals the sum of the individual probabilities: \\(P(E_1 or E_2 \\ldots,or E_k) = P(E_1)+P(E_2)+\\cdots,+P(E_3)\\) Further this helps us to find the probabilities of events ei and gi for two independent sets of events, E and G, respectively: \\(P(e_i and g_i) = P(e_i)P(g_i)\\) For example, a company record book indicates that a waste site has 10 unlabelled buried chemical drums. However, the drums were originally colour coded according to the vapor pressures (P) of the contents: five drums that contain a low vapor pressure (P0 = 10-6 kPa) substance (Plow), two drums that contain a medium vapor pressure (P0 = 10-4 kPa) substance (Pmed), and three drums that contain a very high vapor pressure (P0 = 10-1 kPa) substance (Pvh). To remove the Plow and Pmed drums before calling in special equip teams for the Plow drums that, if ruptured, would release the contents into the air more rapidly. We can determine the probability of pulling up one of the drums that contains substances with a low or medium vapor pressure (i.e. Plow and Pmed). The two possible events (Plow drum or Pmed drum) then, are mutually exclusive and come from the same sample space Thus we have a 70% probability of pulling up a drum with a low to moderate vapor pressure substance. Following the above, A nearby waste site also has 10 unlabelled, buried drums, but with known chemical formulations: three drums that contain dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and seven drums that contain trichloromethane (CHCl3). If there is a possibility that the Pmed substance could be very dangerous in the presence of CHCl3, and the need for special measures to segregate the Pmed and CHCl3. To know the probability of pulling up a Pmed drum from the first site and a CHCl3 drum from the second site. Since the two trials are independent, it can be calculated as Thus we have 6% probability of extracting a medium vapor pressure substance drum and a dichloromethane drum on our first excavation. Thus, there will be a 6% probability of this scenario, unless other steps are taken (e.g. conducting removals on different days) Another important concept for environmental data is that of conditional probability. If we have two dependent sets of events, E and G, the probability that event ek will occur if the dependent event g has previously occurred is shown as p{ek | g}, which is found using Baye’s theorem: A review of this equation shows that conditional probabilities are affected by a cascade of previous events. Thus, the probability of what happens next can be highly dependent upon what has previously occurred. For example, the cumulative risk of cancer depends on the serial (dependent) outcomes. Similarly, reliability can also be affected by dependencies and prior events. Thus, characterizing any risk or determining the reliability of systems are expressions, at least in part, of probability. Air pollution data can also be presented by a “probability density function” (PDF) for data. The PDF is created from a probability density; when the data are plotted in the form of a histogram, as the amount of data increases, the graph increases its smoothness, i.e. the data appear to be continuous. The smooth curve can be expressed mathematically as a function, f(x), which is the PDF. The probability distribution can take many shapes, so the f(x) for each distribution will differ accordingly. For example, in environmental matters, distributions commonly seen are normal, log-normal, and Poisson. The normal (Gaussian) distribution is symmetrical and is best known as the “bell curve”, given its shape (as right Figure). The log-normal distribution is also symmetrical, but its x-axis is plotted as a logarithm of the values. The Poisson distribution is a representation of events that happen with relative infrequency, but regularly. The Poisson distribution function expresses the probability of observing various numbers of a particular event in a sample when the mean probability of that event in any one trial is very small. So, the Poisson probability distribution characterizes discrete events that occur independently of one another during a specific period of time. This is useful for risk assessments, since exposure-related measurements can be expressed as a rate of discrete events, i.e. the number of times an event happens during a defined time interval, such as the frequency (times per week) that a person drives a car. The Poisson distribution describes events that take place during a fixed period of time (i.e. a rate), so long as the individual events are independent of one another. The Poisson equation needed to compute the probability of a specific number of counts being observed over a defined time interval is where, λ - average or expected counts or events per unit time and n - number of encounters. Thus, the Poisson distribution is useful in a risk assessment to estimate exposures. It may be used to characterize the frequency with which a person (or animal or ecosystem) comes into contact with a substance. 3.3 Expressions of Air Pollution Risk Expressions of Air Pollution Risk An event (e) is one of the possible outcomes of a trial (drawn from a population). Risk is a probability. All probabilities, including risk, range from zero to unity, or are stated as a percentage, 0-100%. Risks in a population can be stated as the product of probability and an outcome. This can be stated as a frequency (F) at which the adverse outcome occurs: where, X = number of adverse events; N = number of individuals in the population. For example, if 100 people contact a disease randomly distributed in a population of 100,000, frequency of the disease is 102/105 = 10-3, or one in a thousand. The F term is usually referred to as a probability (P). Air pollution studies often compare populations, e.g. workers exposed to a particular air pollutant compared to the general population. This comparison is known as a relative risk (RR), which is calculated as RR for air pollutants is often stated as a ratio, particularly as a standard mortality ratio or a standard morbidity ratio (both abbreviated to “SMR”): (4.8) where, D = number of deaths for standardized mortality rates or number of diseases for standardized morbidity rates. For example, if 15 out of 10,000 workers who are exposed to air polluted with a metallic compound have died of a type of lung cancer that occurs at a rate of 15 per million, the SMR for this hypothetical cohort of exposed workers would be 15(104)-1 / 15 (106) -1 = 102. This means that the worker’s RR is 100 times that of the general population of dying from this particular type of cancer. The SMR is used as a specific measure of the strength of association between a population’s exposure to an air pollutant and deaths that may be attributed to that exposure. The mortality rate in a community without a specific exposure or intervention is called the baseline rate, which represents the expected level of the mortality. Note that the denominators in Eqs (4.7) and (4.8) include “unexposed” in their subscripts. Actually, these populations are seldom completely unexposed. Workplaces may differ from the general environment not only in the concentrations of certain pollutants, but also in the ways people are exposed. For example, the toxic metal cadmium (Cd) is a pollutant released during the production of batteries (especially, nickel-cadmium [NiCd] types), paints, and coatings, as well as during metal work, e.g. welding, soldering, and plating. Air concentrations of Cd in the workplace can be much higher than in the general environment. In the United States, inhalation is the major route of workplace exposure to Cd. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for Cd fumes or cadmium oxide (CdO) as 0.1 µg m-3 . 3.3.1 Risk Factors and Confounders Risk Factors and Confounders Another way to think about Ens (4.7) and (4.8) is that they show the difference between what is being observed versus what is expected in terms of death and disease. The denominator actually needs to be comparable from one study to the next, i.e. a “standard population” or “reference population”. So, the SMR is employed to compare mortality or morbidity risks of a study population to that of a standard population. The standard population may or may not be an unexposed population. For most air pollutants, the standard population is indeed exposed, but usually are much lower levels than the study group. However, the standard population may actually be more highly exposed to certain air pollutants, such as O3 indoor is usually much lower than that outdoor. 3.4 Causal Links between Risk Factors and Adverse Outcomes Air pollution decision making must infer causality. Risk of an adverse outcome is increased when risk factors are increased in number and size. Two essential attributes of a risk factor is its strength of association and its temporality. 3.4.1 Strength of Association How to associate a particular risk factor, especially an air pollutant, with an adverse outcome? Strong associations provide more certain evidence of causality than is provided by weak associations. Common epidemiological metrics used in association include risk ratio, odds ratio, and standardized mortality ratio. 3.4.2 Consistency Has [the association] been repeatedly observed by different persons, in different places, circumstances and times? Outcomes from laboratory-based and/or field work studies are consistent?! Consistency strengthens the link between exposure to an air pollutant and an adverse effect, e.g. lung cancer. Consider an air pollutant that is positive for mutagenicity, is linked to cancer in mouse and Rhesus monkey experiments, and for which human epidemiological studies show increased cancer incidence 3.4.3 Specificity The specificity criterion holds that the cause should lead to only one disease and that the disease should result from only this single cause. This is rarely the case in studying most chronic diseases, since a chemical can be associated with cancers in numerous organs, and the same chemical may elicit cancer, hormonal, immunological, and neural dysfunctions. In addition, non-chemical stressors may elicit the same chronic effects as chemicals, such as psychological stress and genetic disorders. Thus, for air pollution studies, specificity is not to be expected for many diseases. 3.4.4 Temporality Timing of exposure is critical to causality. For air pollutants, the exposure begins the disease progression process. If the disease occurs before the exposure, the pollutant cannot be considered a cause of the disease. Although the temporality is required for causality, it does not assure causality. That is, if the exposure to the air pollutant occurred after the onset of the disease, that study cannot be used as evidence linking the air pollutant to the disease However, if the exposure occurred prior to the disease, the study may be used, but only if other criteria support the causal link, since another agent or risk factor may be the actual cause of the disease (confounders). 3.5 Biologic Gradient Chemical hazard is usually determined from bioassays, animal studies, epidemiology, and models that generate a biological gradient, i.e. the higher the dose the greater the effect. This is known as the “dose-response” step in risk assessment. Dose-response curves point to thresholds above which air pollutant exposures are expected to elicit effects (e.g. above a “no observable adverse effect level”). Air pollution is hazardous to both human health and ecosystems, so the biological response may manifest itself as diseases and death in human populations and as damage to habitats and organisms living in ecosystems 3.5.1 Coherence All available evidence concerning the natural history and biology of the disease should “stick together” (cohere) to form a cohesive whole. For air pollution, temporal patterns of exposure and adverse effects must adhere to what is known about the associated biological effects. If animal data suggest that inhaling a substance leads to a respiratory effect, but human data do not, this is an example of lack of coherence. Lack of coherence may be the result of paucity of human data; Lack of coherence may also result from intraspecies differences for which human studies have not yet been properly designed; Lack of coherence, then, does not in itself eliminate a causal link. Conversely, if all studies are coherent, it very strongly suggests a causal link. 3.5.2 Experimentation Experimental evidence in support of a causal hypothesis may come in the form of community and clinical trials, in vitro and in vivo laboratory experiments, animal models, and natural experiments. The relationship between an air pollutant and an adverse outcome is usually multifaceted. Slight differences in chemistry, physical form, and biological makeup of the receptor organism cannot usually be duplicated with well-controlled experiments. Thus, the results are usually very specific to the independent and dependent variables in study and not easily extrapolated to actual, real-world situations. 3.6 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Systems Context for Air Pollution Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one increasingly useful and reliable tool for air pollution decision making. Air pollution must be understood systematically and includes steps that involve energy and various types of matter, both living and nonliving. The life cycle perspective avoids arbitrary divisions among air pollution, water pollution, land pollution, and the like. The fundamentals include a sound basis for designing and selecting the appropriate air pollution control equipment or understanding the chemical reactions that lead to the emission of air pollutants. Energy production is a major source of air pollution. Energy concerns are at the forefront of political, policy, and scientific decisions. 3.7 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Energy Modern life depends on energy in all of its forms, including mechanical, thermal, chemical, acoustic, and nuclear energy. Most of the earth’s available energy comes from the sun. The fusion and fission of the sun emits large amounts of electromagnetic radiation, some of which finds its way to the earth (i.e., sunlight). Plants use and store this energy by photosynthesis; Animals use the stored energy for respiration; The remains of these plants and animals are deposited, and under pressure and over vast periods of time, energy is captured in minerals, known as fossil fuels. The sun is also the source of many so-called alternative energy sources. Most obvious is solar energy. Wind is actually a type of solar energy, since the heating of the atmosphere leads to air movements. Bioenergy systems, e.g. algae and wood, are also solar, given that they derive their energy from photosynthesis and respiration. The only “nonsolar” energy source on the earth is nuclear energy; Radioactive elements have unstable nuclei that emit radiation as they decay. Choosing the best energy source is complicated. The most contentious and important are the public health and environmental impacts of the various energy sources. An electric car may appear to be much cleaner than a gasoline-powered car, based solely on tailpipe emissions. The comparison becomes more complicated when the major source of electricity is coal that, when burned, emits large amounts of pollution from a stationary source, i.e. the power plant. The best way to consider the air pollution impacts of energy production, distribution, and transport is to employ a life cycle assessment (LCA). In the electricity versus internal combustion example, the electric car system would emit large amounts of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and heavy metals (including mercury [Hg]) from a central source. Conversely, each gasoline-powered car would emit much smaller amounts of PM; volatile organic compounds (VOCs), like benzene; and other pollutants, but the overall emissions from millions of small mobile sources (vehicles) is what is important. 3.8 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Energy Life Cycles The environmental acceptability of any energy source must be evaluated systematically. This is demonstrated by the LCA (see Figure). Burning 100-L fuel A to manufacture 1000 kg of product Y releasing 100 kg of SO2 per year versus burning 150 L of fuel B to manufacture the same amount of product Z, but releasing 300 kg of SO2 per year. If this were the only criterion, fuel A would unquestionably be the best choice. It uses 50% less fuel (more energy efficient) and releases one-third of the pollutant. However, looking further back into the life cycle in Figure 5.1, It is found that fuel A requires that 1 t of earth is removed to produce 100 L of fuel A, but fuel B requires no extraction (it is generated from recycled food oils, e.g. biodiesel). It would appear that, early in the life cycle, fuel A has a much higher environmental cost (damage) than does fuel B. It could be that the extraction process does not emit a large amount of air pollutants, although such processes usually do, often in the form of fugitive dust (PM). Extraction activities almost always damage ecosystems, soil, and water systems. Furthermore, the two fuels will have different costs and benefits at the other levels. Spatial harm occurs when a contaminant is released into the environment and causes immediate harm within a defined distance of the release. For example, an atmospheric plume may be transported to places where it causes additional harm. Within the plume, chemical transformation may occur by abiotic and biotic processes to form new compounds, which may be more or less reactive and toxic and which may build up in the environment after they are deposited from the atmosphere. Temporal harm can take the form of short-term impacts.时间性伤害 A substance is released into the environment, rendering an immediate, acute impact. Such a response can range from the highly circumscribed with little impact (e.g. release of a highly reactive substance in sufficiently low quantities and distance between the release and the receptor, so that it breaks down long before causing any harm) to disastrous (an immediate release of sufficiently large quantities of a substance that reach the receptor and elicit effects to a large population of receptors). The insult may be either isolated or episodic (e.g. one-time event like thermal inversion during a confluence of events, such as an explosion, where large amounts of contaminants are released and remain for a protracted time period), or it may be continuous, e.g. a water heater that releases carbon monoxide due to inadequate air-to-gas ratios, a leak from a propane tank valve into the atmosphere, or a slow release of gasoline (benzeneetolueneeethylbenzeneexylene) from an underground storage tank over decades into the groundwater and atmosphere. The top box in Figure 5.2 includes emissions from every step in the energy life cycle, from extraction (e.g. PM from mining and volatilization of compounds from crude oil and natural gas extraction) to releases of air pollutants from refining and processing to emissions from vehicles and other sources during combustion to releases from landfills, incinerators, recycling, and other end-of-life systems. Mass must be balanced. 3.8.1 Upstream Impacts Every energy source has upstream impacts. Coal and uranium must be mined, crude oil and natural gas drilled, and trees harvested. This also extends to “non-emitting” sources. Construction of materials extracted from the earth. After extraction, the manufacturing processes are also part of the upstream stage of the life cycle for all energy sources, i.e., decentralized system, wind turbines installed on buildings, as well as related facility. The footprint of these large systems can be substantial in terms of time, materials, and energy demands. 3.9 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Environmental Justice during Extraction A complete LCA consideration must include societal factors. A particularly illustrative example is justice. “Environmental justice” communities have two characteristics: They have experienced historical (usually multigenerational) exposures to disproportionately high doses of potentially harmful substances (the environmental part). They have certain specified socioeconomic and demographic characteristics 社会经济学和人口学特征, including a low SES; are racial and ethnic; and are historically a disadvantaged people. 3.10 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Fuel Cycle Impacts Some fuels are usable directly as extracted, e.g. natural gas and coal, but often need to be changed physically to aid transport and combustion. The natural gas may be compressed for ease in cross-oceanic transport. Coal will be crushed and even pulverized, depending on the combustion requirements. Processing uranium ore into usable fuel may require large amounts of energy, often from fossil fuels. Thus, even though the nuclear reactions themselves produce no greenhouse gases or other pollutants, the processing steps certainly will. 3.10.1 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Operation Stage After extraction and fuel processing, each energy system is operated over its design life. During this life, fossil fuels are burned, nuclear reactions occur, and biota grow. Combustion 燃烧（分解 The largest human-induced source of many air pollutants is the combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity. The principal contributor to Hg, CO2, and SO2 emissions has been coal-fired power plants. The interactions of ions in precipitation (i.e. H+, SO4-2 , NO3- ) with organic and inorganic constituents of soil and water affect toxicity. Particularly important is the leaching of potentially toxic elements, especially aluminum, from rocks and soils by acidic precipitation. Complete or efficient combustion (thermal oxidation) converts hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water: Combustion is the combination of O2 in the presence of heat (as in burning fuel), producing CO2 and H2O during complete combustion of organic compounds, such as the combustion of octane: Complete combustion may also result in the production of molecular nitrogen (N2) when nitrogen-containing organics are burned, such as in the combustion of methylamine Incomplete combustion can produce a variety of compounds. Some are more toxic than the original compounds being oxidized, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, furans, and CO. Incomplete combustion reactions are very important sources of air pollutants. 3.11 空氣污染氣象學 大氣對污染物的四種作用: 輸送作用: 風速、風向決定污染物輸送範圍及大小 擴散作用: 主要指垂直方向的擴散，與地表粗糙度、大氣穩定度及混合層高度有關。 轉化作用: 污染物質於大氣中因自身衰減或與其他污染物或受陽光照射之作用，發生化學變化。轉化成其他物質而造成二次污染，如光化學反應。 移除作用: 大氣中之污染物質因下列過程而從大氣中消失。 微粒物質因重力而沉降至地表 因降雨或降雪的洗除 被雪粒、水蒸氣包圍而成凝結核。 上述作用中，以輸送效應最大，而影響大氣輸送最主要的因子為盛行風(Praevailing Wind). 影響大氣中空氣污染物輸送與擴散之因子 大氣穩定度: 風速、風向、溫度梯度 (Temperature gradient)、日照、雲量等。 混合層高度: 定義為地面上受到亂流作用而使污染物得以擴散至混合的高度。 局部環流: 熱島效應、海陸風、下沖作用 氣壓與污染物之擴散 低壓地區常伴隨多雲且不穩定的天氣，風速亦較大，有利於污染物之擴散，其伴隨之雨水亦可移除大氣中之污染物。 高壓地區通常是晴朗穩定的天氣，風速亦較小，若有滯留高壓或沉降逆溫層的存在，則污染物之擴散及輸送均極不易，因此高污染事件好發於冬季。 3.11.1 風速與風向 風速 目前以計算有效煙囪高度處之風速，最簡便而常用的方法為利用風速冪次律(Power Law)。 風向 風向之定義為風的來向，通常將風向分為16個方位，並將逐時的風速大小描繪在該方向而形成風花圖(Wind Rose)。線條長短為風速出現的百分比。 3.11.2 大氣垂直溫度結構與安定度 溫降傾率(Lapse Rate) 當少量空氣在大氣層中向上移動，會因壓力降低而膨脹並降低溫度，通常該膨脹相當快速，可假設該氣團與周圍大氣間並未發生熱量轉移(假設為絕熱狀態)。 對一空氣圓柱，厚度差異dz所產生之靜態平衡如下: dP = - \\(\\rho gdz\\) (2-2) 3.11.3 大氣溫降傾率與大氣穩定性之關係 Weak Lapse Rate – Weakly stable 大氣之盛行溫降傾率小於乾絕熱溫降傾率 (1)當氣團從C上升至A，氣團溫度T1低於大氣環境溫度T2，故氣團將在下降(因溫度低，密度較大，下降) (2)氣團由C下降至B，氣團溫度T4高於大氣環境溫度T3，故氣團將在上升(因溫度高，密度較小，上升) (3)此狀態為一穩定狀態，限制了氣團垂直運動，妨礙上下混合作用。 Strong Lapse Rate – Unstable 大氣之盛行溫降傾率大於乾絕熱溫降傾率。 (1)當氣團從C上升至A，氣團溫度T2高於大氣環境溫度T1，故氣團將繼續上升。 (2)氣團由C下降至B，氣團溫度T3低於大氣環境溫度T4，故氣團將繼續下降。 (3)此狀態大氣垂直對流旺盛，利於污染物之擴散，系統為不穩定。 Neutral Stable 大氣之盛行溫降傾率等於乾絕熱溫降傾率。 氣團受外力後才有升降動作，若外力消失，則此氣團安定於新的位置，稱為中性穩定或隨意穩定。 結論 溫降傾率與大氣穩定性的關係如右圖 3.11.4 溫層逆轉 當高度升高時，氣溫亦隨之上升，亦即溫暖空氣在冷空氣上面，為一種弱溫降傾率之極端現象，空氣污染物無法向上擴散。 輻射性逆轉(Radiation Inversion) 在良好氣候下，因陽光照射使地面溫度較高，藉由對流作用，氣溫高之空氣向上升，形成遞減現象；但在夜間，地面之熱能向較冷的天空輻射，地表溫度急速冷卻而上層空氣未循比例冷卻，稱為輻射逆轉。因其高度約在200公尺以下，故又稱為接地逆轉，隨著早晨日照之開始，逆轉消失。 沉降性逆轉(Subsidence Inversion) 在高氣壓圈內，由於反旋風空氣之沉降，圈內空氣向外側吹，上層空氣沉降遞補，因絕熱壓縮，故沉降之空氣溫度會上升，因而形成逆轉。 地形性逆轉 在谷地中，由於冷空氣沿著地表流入谷底之結果，使得空氣約接近地面溫度越低，越往上則溫度越高。於夜間又與輻射逆轉結合在一起，使逆轉更加擴大。 3.11.5 大氣安定度與煙柱型態（氣象學的部分和空氣污染有關） 煙柱之擴散與大氣之溫降傾率有關，煙柱之形狀可作為判定大氣條件是否安定之依據 3.11.6 地形與地理位置對煙流型態之影響 溫暖而乾燥之區域(易輻射) 上午易發生燻煙型 (Fumigation) 下午傍晚，地面逆轉層易於形成，由煙囪高度(hs)決定煙流型態 Hs &gt;= 逆轉層高度 - 屋頂型(Lofting) Hs &lt;=逆轉層高度 – 扇形(Faning)或侷煙型(Trapping) 多雲而潮濕區域 盛行溫降傾率通常為濕絕熱型態(Wet Adiabatic Rate)，屬於弱溫降傾率(Weak Lapse Rate)的圓錐形(Coning)較常見。 多雲的情況下 地面之輻射逆轉層不易形成。 3.11.7 混合層高度 基於地表因受熱而在垂直方向產生強烈的混合，並將熱量傳輸給大氣，其伸展至某高度直到受到逆溫層所阻擋，此高度即為混合層高度。 在混合層內，污染物所能垂直混合的上限高度即為混合層高度，主要決定於亂流混合的強度(與風速、風向、地面粗糙度、太陽照射、及大氣垂直溫度結構有關)。 1. 混合層高度最大值一般發生在午後2-3點，為排放氣體最佳時機 2. 混合層高度最小值一般發生在清晨5-6點。 3.11.8 局部環流對污染物的影響 熱島效應 (Heat Island): 由於鄉村與都市溫度差引起之局部環流。 由於都市之輻射程度較鄉村劇烈，都市上空有上升氣流，利於污染物之擴散及稀釋。然而，在夜間至日出之間，由於穩定度增加，阻止環流產生，使污染物靜止懸浮於都市上空，日出後都市上空之污染物阻止輻射熱之吸收，鄉村之增溫率較大，形成由鄉村吹向都市之局部環流，而都市上空則有下降氣流，不利污染物擴散，故在都會區晨間運動應盡量在日出前。 海陸風 (Land-Sea Circulation): 發生在海陸交界，以24小時為週期之一種空氣局地環流，因陸地與海洋熱力性質差異所引起。 白天時，因陸地地面之比熱較海水小(陸地加熱和冷卻速率都比水快)，故陸地上之空氣上升而海面上的空氣下降，形成海風環流而將海面上的污染物吹向內陸，增加地面污染。反之夜間形成陸風循環，將都市內污染物吹向海上，減輕地面污染。 下沖作用 (Down Wash): 氣流遇障礙物而在其背風處造成氣流的下降。下沖作用有以下兩種: 氣流遇障礙物而在其背風處造成細流的下沖 空氣動力效應引起之下沖作用，即廢氣之排放速度小於煙囪口之盛行風速，煙流未即上升即迅速被往下帶。當廢氣排放速度與風速比值大於1.5時，即可避免。 山谷風(Mountain-Valley Wind) 因地形造成的局部環流，除了海陸風以外，另一種為山谷風，也是由不同冷卻程度所產生。在夜間，山谷中高度較高的地方其溫度較低，故空氣在夜間將流下到谷底，谷底的氣團被其上方的暖空氣困住，直到次日中午，股中空氣才有足夠熱量使逆轉瓦解。 海陸風及山谷風在氣象學上對空氣污染相當重要，因大型火力發電廠通常設在海岸或大湖附近。此情況下，煙囪之排放物在白天將由海風帶向內陸上空。而山谷中之污染源，白天煙柱將沿山谷上升，而晚上風吹向谷底，使煙柱由回到谷底，污染物濃度可能會累積到危險的程度 做都市規劃之時，應該先瞭解氣象條件！ 老師説不要退選啦XD "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
