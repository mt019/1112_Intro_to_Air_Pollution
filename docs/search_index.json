Air pollution terminology generally breaks matter down into two phases, particulate and gas. - Particulates and aerosols are generally synonymous terms in air pollution literature, i.e. liquid and solid phase. They are distinguished from gases and vapors. Thermodynamic systems are classified into two major types: closed and open. A closed system does not allow material to enter or leave the system (refer to “control mass”); a open system allows material to enter and leave the systems (known as “control volume”). Another thermodynamic concept is that of the “property”. An intensive property is independent of the system’s mass (such as pressure and temperature). An extensive property is proportional to the mass of the system (such as density or volume). Dividing the value of an extensive property by the system’s mass gives a “specific property”, such as specific heat, specific volume, or specific gravity. The thermodynamic term for the description of the change of a system from one stage (e.g. equilibrium) to another is known as a “process”. 描述系统从一个阶段（例如平衡）到另一个阶段的变化的热力学术语被称为”过程”。 Processes may be reversible or irreversible; they may be adiabatic (no gain or loss of heat, so all energy transfers occur through work interactions) or non-adiabatic (will be introduced in the following chapters). 过程可能是可逆的或不可逆的；它们可能是绝热的（没有热量的得失，因此所有能量传递都是通过工作相互作用发生的）或非绝热的（将在以下章节中介绍）。 Other processes include isometric (constant volume), isothermal (constant temperature), isobaric (constant pressure), isentropic (constant entropy), and isenthalpic (constant enthalpy). 其他的过程包括等距（恒定体积）、等温（恒温）、等压（恒压）、等熵（恒熵）、等高温（恒移差）。 Phases partitioning means the substance will exist in one or more physical phases. An important partitioning coefficient for air pollution is Henry’s Law, which states that the partial pressure of a compound can be related to its equilibrium concentration in a dilute aqueous solution through a constant of proportionality. 阶段划分意味着物质将存在于一个或多个物理阶段。空气污染的一个重要分配系数是亨利定律，该定律指出，化合物的分压可以通过比例常数与其在稀水溶液中的平衡浓度有关。 \\(e^p = e^{kc}\\) e ≈2.71828; p:溶液上的氣體分壓(partial pressure) C: 溶液體積莫耳濃度; k: Henry constant (因溶劑和溫度的不同而感變) A varying number of molecules will find their way into the air, even though most of the molecules remain in the water, i.e. dissolved in water. Even a small amount of partitioning can account for large amounts of vapor phase compounds in the atmosphere. 不同数量的分子会找到进入空气的途径，即使大部分分子留在水中，即溶解在水中。即使是少量的分隔也可以解释大气中大量的气相化合物。 The predominant vapor in the air is, not surprisingly, water vapor. 空气中的主要蒸气是水蒸气，这并不奇怪。 In the atmosphere, above their temperature of condensation, vapor molecules act just like permanent gas molecules in the air; below its condensation temperature, if the air is saturated, water changes from vapor to liquid. 在大气中，在其冷凝温度之上，蒸气分子的作用就像空气中的永久性气体分子；低于其冷凝温度，如果空气饱和，水从蒸气变为液体。 This phenomenon gives rise to fog or mist in the air and condensed liquid water on cool surfaces exposed to air. 这种现象在空气中产生雾或雾，在暴露于空气的凉爽表面上凝结液态水。 Gaseous composition in Tables 1.1 is expressed as parts per million by volume - ppm (vol.) or ppmV. 單位很重要！！！ 濃度轉換 &gt; To convert from units of ppm (vol.) to µg m-3 , it is assumed that the ideal gas law is accurate under ambient conditions. A generalized formula for the conversion at 25 °C and 760 mmHg is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{1ppm(vol.) pollutant} &amp;=\\mathrm{\\frac{1l pollutant}{10^6 1 air}}\\\\ &amp;=\\mathrm{\\frac{(1l/22.4)\\times MW \\times 10^6 \\mu g }{}} \\end{aligned}\\] Where MW equals molecular weight (g mol-1). For convenience, conversion units for common pollutants are shown in Table 1.3 (next slide) More than 90% of the degradation of methane is by oxidation, mainly by reactions with the hydroxyl radical in the stratosphere which accounts for more than 90% of methane loss. The equilibria and fate of CO2, CH4, and other carbon compounds are discussed in detail in the following chapters. Essential compounds include micronutrients needed by plant life and other organisms in the ecosystems. However, even essential substances can become pollutants in the wrong concentrations. Thus, expression of chemical concentration is crucial to understanding atmospheric science generally and the fundamentals of air pollution specifically. "],["課間.html", "Chapter 2 課間", " Chapter 2 課間 2.0.1 Chemical Concentration Atmospheric concentrations can be expressed as combinations of mass and volume, usually volume per volume or mass per volume. 大气浓度可以表示为质量和体积的组合，通常是体积/体积或质量/体积。 The higher the vapor pressure of a substance, the more of the molecules of that substance finds its way to the atmosphere. This exchange among solid, liquid, and gas phases, including vaporization, is discussed in detail in the following chapters. 物质的蒸气压越高，该物质进入大气的分子越多。以下各章将详细讨论固体、液体和气体相之间的这种交换，包括汽化。 Atmospheric concentrations can be both spatial and temporal variability, such as the differences in ambient concentrations in various urban areas and seasonal differences in the same urban area. 大气浓度可以是空间和时间上的变异性，例如不同城市地区的环境浓度差异和同一城市地区的季节差异。 Although the total amount of substances under the category “organic vapors” is somewhat constant on a global atmospheric scale, it is highly variable in the ambient air (e.g. much higher concentrations near a wood processing facility) and even more variable between ambient and indoor air, as indicated in Table 1.5. 尽管”有机蒸气”类别下的物质总量在全球大气尺度上有些恒定，但在环境空气中变化很大（例如木材加工设施附近的浓度高得多），在环境空气和室内空气之间变化更大，如表1.5所示。 The variability in chemical concentrations can be even greater among various types of indoor environments. 各类室内环境中化学浓度的变化可能更大。 The concentration of an air pollutant that is expected and permitted will vary according to the protection needed in ambient air and various personal and workplace microenvironments 预期和允许的空气污染物浓度将根据环境空气以及各种个人和工作场所微环境所需的保护而变化 2.0.2 Atmospheric Fluid Properties The term “fluid” includes all liquids and gases. A liquid is a form of matter that is composed of molecules that move freely among themselves without separating from each other. A gas is a form of matter that is composed of molecules that move freely and are infinitely able to occupy the space in which they are contained at a constant temperature. The medium itself, gases like carbon monoxide, vapors like benzene, and liquid aerosols. Water is a key fluid, such as its vapor phase (e.g. clouds, fog, and steam) and its liquid phase (e.g. droplets, surface and groundwater interactions with the atmosphere). “流体”一词包括所有液体和气体。 液体是物质的一种形式，由在彼此之间自由移动而不相互分离的分子组成。 气体是物质的一种形式，由自由移动的分子组成，并无限能够在恒温下占据它们所包含的空间。 介质本身，气体如一氧化碳，蒸气如苯，液态气溶胶。 水是一种关键流体，如蒸气相（例如云、雾和蒸汽）及其液相（例如液滴、地表和地下水与大气的相互作用）。 It is a common practice to add concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide in ppm (vol.) and express the sum as “oxides of nitrogen”. In metric units, conversion from ppm (vol.) to µg m-3 must be calculated separately for nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide prior to addition. 在ppm（vol.）中添加二氧化氮和一氧化氮浓度，并将和表示为”氮氧化物”是一种常见的做法。在公制单位中，从ppm（vol.）转换为µg m-3必须在添加之前分别计算二氧化氮和一氧化氮。 Density is a very important fluid property for any air pollution situation. If a pollutant is very dense, such as a heavy particle, it will stay aloft for a much shorter time and distance than will a lighter particle of the same shape and size. 2.0.3 The Science of Air Pollution- Air Pollution in perspective Biologists may think of how contaminants in the air affect living things. Ecologists are often interested in how exposures to air pollutants affect biodiversity and overall ecosystem health. Biomedical scientists are concerned about the diseases associated with various air contaminants. Toxicologists, in particular, are interested in how these effects differ from one species to another and from one type of contaminant to another. It is not unusual for a compound to be acutely toxic at low doses for fish, but acutely toxic in mammals only at much higher doses. 生物学家可能会想到空气中的污染物如何影响生物。 生态学家常常对空气污染物的暴露如何影响生物多样性和整体生态系统健康感兴趣。 生物医学科学家关注与各种空气污染物相关的疾病。 毒理学家尤其对这些影响在不同物种之间以及从一种污染物到另一种污染物之间有何不同感兴趣。 一种化合物在低剂量时对鱼类剧毒的情况并不罕见，但在哺乳动物中剧毒的情况仅在高剂量时才是如此。 Biological specialists have myriad concerns about air pollution, such as geneticists’ interest in how pollutants may change genetic material in organisms or how genetically modified organisms may be transported into the atmosphere and potentially reach human populations and ecosystems. Epidemiologists are interested in how the exposure and effects of air pollutants differ in time and space. Chemists are often concerned about the various types of pollutants. For example, they may be interested in how reactive or persistent certain compounds are after they are released from a stack, vent, or tailpipe. How the compounds change after release, i.e. what reactions occur in the atmosphere after release. 生物专家对空气污染有许多关切，例如遗传学家对污染物如何改变生物中的遗传物质或转基因生物如何被运输到大气中并可能到达人类人口和生态系统的兴趣。 流行病学家对空气污染物的暴露和影响在时间和空间上有何不同感兴趣。 化学家经常关注各类污染物。例如，它们可能对某些化合物从堆栈、通风口或排气管释放后的反应性或持久性有兴趣。 化合物释放后如何变化，即释放后大气中发生什么反应。 This is also the concern of physicists, who want to explain the thermodynamics and motion that is involved in this transfer and the fate of air pollutants as they are created and after they are released. People living near an industrial complex likely will see frequent, visible signs of pollution, such as dark plumes emitted from smoke stacks or hazy conditions on certain days. A person with asthma may be more concerned about certain air pollutants than those who have never experienced breathing problems. Students who have taken a few earth science or meteorology courses, hopefully, will be more aware of even subtle forms of pollution than are lesser informed people. 这也是物理学家关注的问题，他们想解释这种转移所涉及的热力学和运动，以及空气污染物产生时和释放后的命运。 居住在工业园区附近的人们可能会看到频繁而明显的污染迹象，如烟囱发出的深色羽毛或某些日子的朦胧状况。 哮喘患者可能比从未经历过呼吸问题的人更关心某些空气污染物。 参加过几门地球科学或气象学课程的学生，希望会比了解情况较少的人更了解甚至微妙的污染形式。 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines air pollution as the presence of contaminants or pollutant substances in the air that interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects. Most pollutants cannot be sufficiently and accurately detected solely by the five human senses. Many are odorless, colorless, and otherwise undetectable. Even those that are inherently detectable with unaided human senses, such as hydrogen sulfide’s (H2S) rotten egg odor or orange color of lead oxide (PbO), are sensed only at concentrations well above thresholds of harm. “What you don’t know won’t harm you” is not true for most air pollutants. 美国环境保护署（EPA）将空气污染定义为空气中存在干扰人类健康或福利，或产生其他有害环境影响的污染物或污染物物质。 大多数污染物不能仅靠人类的五种感官就能得到充分和准确的检测。许多是无味、无色的，否则是无法检测到的。 即使是那些固有地可以用人类独立感官检测到的物质，例如硫化氢（H2S）腐烂的蛋味或橙色的氧化铅（PbO），也只能在远远高于危害阈值的浓度下被感知到。 “你不知道的不会伤害你”对于大多数空气污染物来说都不是真的。 2.0.4 The Science of Air Pollution- Emergence of Air Pollution, Engineering, and Technology Environmental awareness is certainly more “mainstream” and less a polarizing issue than it was in the 1970s, when key legislation reflected the new environmental ethos. The 1970 Clean Air Act codified the national need to decrease air pollution by requiring federal standards for ambient air quality. Not only are the environmental disciplines young, but also many of the environmental problems faced today differ from those throughout most of human history. 2.0.5 The Science of Air Pollution- What is Air Pollution When does science consider the atmosphere to be unpolluted versus polluted? To compare the condition of the atmosphere currently against some type of baseline, e.g. pre-industrialized atmosphere prior to the nineteenth century. Another approach is to consider the principles by which materials are released into the atmosphere, move, transform, and are removed from the atmosphere, and based on this assessment determine the extent of atmospheric pollution. The same chemical compounds or particles from a natural source (e.g. a volcano) elicit the same adverse effects as when they are emitted by anthropogenic sources. Air pollution implies acceptability Air pollutants affect both human health and ecosystems. Approximately two million people in rural areas die each year from exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter (PM) suspended in the indoor air. Excess mortality due to outdoor PM and sulfur dioxide contribute to mortality of about 500,000 people annually. In the United States, the Clean Air Act of 1970 established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to address six so-called “criteria air pollutants”: particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and lead (Pb). The clearest association of toxic air pollutants in recent decades has been with cancer, although neurotoxicity (especially in children) from lead and mercury grew in importance in the 1970s and 1980s. By the end of the twentieth century, new toxic pollutants also competed for the public’s attention, including air pollutants that threaten hormonal systems in humans and wildlife, as well as those associated with immune system disorders. 2.0.5.1 Particulate Matter PM is always suspended in various concentrations in the troposphere. Particles are aggregates of many molecules, sometimes of similar molecules, often of dissimilar ones. They form and transform in the air by several processes. Some particles serve as nuclei upon which vapors condense. Some particles react chemically with atmospheric gases or vapors to form different compounds. When two particles collide in the air, they tend to adhere to each other because of attractive surface forces, thereby forming progressively larger and larger particles by agglomeration. 对流层中的PM总是以各种浓度悬浮。 粒子是许多分子的聚集体，有时是相似的分子，往往是不同的分子。它们通过几个过程在空中形成和转化。 一些粒子作为原子核,蒸气在其上凝结.一些粒子与大气气体或蒸气发生化学反应，形成不同的化合物。 当两个粒子在空气中碰撞时，由于有吸引力的表面力，它们倾向于相互粘附，从而通过聚集而逐渐形成越来越大的粒子。 The larger a particle becomes, the greater its weight and the greater its likelihood of falling to the ground (sedimentation) rather than remaining airborne. Washout of particles by snowflakes, rain, hail, sleet, mist, or fog is a common form of agglomeration and sedimentation. Other particles leave the air by impaction onto and retention by the solid surfaces of vegetation, soil, and buildings. The particulate matter in the atmosphere is dynamic - continual injection into the air from sources of small particles; creation of particles in the air by vapor condensation or chemical reaction among gases and vapors; and removal of particles from the air by agglomeration, sedimentation, or impaction. As mentioned earlier, the true natural background concentration will never be known. The best that can be done now is to assume that the particulate levels at remote places - the middle of the sea, the poles, and the mountaintops - approach the true background concentration. PM is a common physical classification of particles found in the air, such as dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. PM is not a specific chemical entity but is a mixture of particles from different sources and of different sizes, compositions, and properties. The chemical composition of PM is very important and highly variable, which can tell us much about its sources, e.g. receptor models use chemical composition and morphology of particles as a means to trace pollutants back to the source. PM是空气中常见的粒子物理分类，如尘埃、污垢、烟尘、烟雾和液滴。 PM不是一个特定的化学实体，而是来自不同来源和不同大小、组成和性质的粒子的溷合物。 PM的化学成分非常重要，变化很大，这可以很好地告诉我们它的来源，例如受体模型使用化学成分和颗粒形态作为追踪污染物回源的手段。 The chemical composition of tropospheric particles includes inorganic ions, metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and crustal substances (e.g. carbonates and compounds of alkali and rare earth elementals). Some atmospheric particles can be hygroscopic, i.e. they contain particle-bound water. The organic fraction can be particularly difficult to characterize, since it often contains thousands of organic compounds. Particles range from ultrafine to coarse; the size of a particle is determined by how the particle is formed. If particles are sufficiently small and of low mass, they can be suspended in the air for long periods of time. Sources of particles are highly variable. Particles may be emitted directly to the air from stationary sources, such as factories, power plants, and open burning, and from moving vehicles (known as “mobile sources”), first by direct emissions from internal combustion engines, but also when these and other particles are re-entrained due to the movement of vehicles (e.g. in a “near-road” situation) 如果粒子足够小，质量低，可以长时间悬浮在空气中。 粒子的来源变化很大。 颗粒可直接从固定源（如工厂、发电厂、露天燃烧）和移动车辆（称为”移动源”）排放到空气中，首先是由内燃机直接排放，但也可在这些颗粒和其他颗粒由于车辆移动而被重新夹带时（例如在”近距离”情况下） The volume (mass) distribution is called bimodal because of its separate maxima at about 0.2 and 10 µm, which result from different mechanisms of particle formation. The mode with the 0.2-µm maximum results from coagulation and condensation formation mechanisms. They are called fine particles to differentiate them from the particles in the 10-µm maximum mode, which are called coarse. These fine particles are primarily sulfates, nitrates, organics, ammonium, and lead compounds. 体积（质量）分布被称为双峰，因为它在约0.2和10 µm处分离的最大值，这是由不同的粒子形成机制所产生的。 最大为0.2 µm的模式是由凝结和凝结形成机制所产生的。它们被称为细粒子，以区别于10-µm最大模式下的粒子，称为粗粒子。 这些细颗粒主要是硫酸盐、硝酸盐、有机物、铵和铅化合物。 The mode with the 10-µm maximum are particles introduced to the atmosphere as solids from the surface of the earth and the seas, plus particles from the coagulation-condensation mode which have grown larger and moved across the trough between the modes into the larger size mode. These are primarily silicon, iron, aluminum, sea salt, and plant particles. The majority of particles in the atmosphere are spherical in shape because they are formed by condensation or cooling processes or they contain core nuclei coated with liquid. Other important particle shapes exist in the atmosphere; e.g. asbestos is present as long fibers and fly ash can be irregular in shape. The amount of each element or radical, anion, or cation that is present in the mixture can be determined. Specific organic compounds may be separated and identified. The shapes of individual particles may be analyzed by electron microscopy. Particle size dictates the necessary control technologies, determines the types of health and environmental problems to be expected when particles are inhaled and retained by the human respiratory system and when particles absorb and scatter incoming solar radiation. 10 µm最大值的模式是作为固体从地球表面和海洋引入大气层的粒子，加上凝结-凝结模式的粒子，这些粒子已经变得更大，并且在模式之间跨槽移动到更大的尺寸模式。这些主要是硅、铁、铝、海盐和植物颗粒。 大气中的大部分粒子是球形的，因为它们是由冷凝或冷却过程形成的，或者含有涂有液体的核核。 大气中还存在其他重要的粒子形状；例如石棉存在于长纤维和粉煤灰可以是不规则的形状。 可以确定溷合物中存在的每个元素或自由基、阴离子或阳离子的量。 可以分离和鉴定特定的有机化合物。 单个粒子的形状可以用电子显微镜分析。 粒径决定了必要的控制技术，决定了人类呼吸系统吸入和保留粒子以及粒子吸收和散射进入的太阳辐射时预期的健康和环境问题类型。 2.0.6 The Science of Air Pollution- Atmospheric Transport and Fate Air pollutants are studied from at least three perspectives: the sources, the movement, and the receptors. The sources of air pollutants vary in size (e.g. tons emitted per year), type (e.g. stationary or mobile) and composition (e.g. coke oven emissions include thousands of compounds, but many smelters include a handful of metals). Movement can range from molecular diffusion to continental and global transport in winds aloft. Receptors include humans, ecosystems, and materials. 至少从三个角度研究空气污染物：来源、运动和受体。 空气污染物的来源在大小（例如每年排放的吨）、类型（例如固定式或移动式）和成分（例如焦炉排放物包括数千种化合物,但许多冶炼厂包括少量金属）方面各不相同。 运动范围从分子扩散到大风中的大陆和全球运输. 受体包括人类、生态系统和物质。 2.0.7 Sources and Sinks The places from which pollutants emanate are called sources. There are natural as well as anthropogenic sources of the particles and gases considered to be pollutants. Plant and animal respiration and the decay of what was once living matter; . Volcanoes and naturally caused forest fires are other natural sources. A special type of natural sources are biogenic, which are living things that release a variety of pollutants, both organic (e.g. volatiles like pinene) and inorganic (e.g. carbon dioxide [CO2] and methane [CH4]). 污染物产生的地方称为来源。 有被认为是污染物的颗粒和气体的自然和人为来源。 植物和动物的呼吸以及曾经生物的腐烂；火山和自然引起的森林火灾是其他自然来源。 一种特殊类型的自然来源是生物来源，它们是释放各种污染物的生物，包括有机污染物（例如，像松烯这样的挥发物）和无机污染物（例如，二氧化碳［CO2］和甲烷［CH4］）。 The places to which pollutants disappear from the air are called sinks. Sinks include the soil, vegetation, structures, and water bodies, particularly the oceans. The mechanisms whereby pollutants are removed from the atmosphere are called scavenging mechanisms. The measure used for the aging of a pollutant is its half-life - the time it takes for half of the quantity of a pollutant emanating from a source to disappear into its various sinks. Most pollutants have a rather short half-life (i.e. days rather than decades) that prevents their accumulation in the air to the extent that they substantially alter the composition of unpolluted air. 污染物从空气中消失的地方称为汇。 水槽包括土壤、植被、结构和水体，特别是海洋。 污染物从大气中清除的机制称为清除机制。 用于污染物老化的措施是其半衰期，即从一个源发出的污染物数量的一半消失到其各种汇中所需的时间。 大多数污染物的半衰期较短（即几天而不是几十年），可防止污染物在空气中积聚，从而大大改变未污染空气的成分。 Several gases do appear to be accumulating in the air to the extent that measurements have documented the increase in concentration from year to year. Such as CO2, nitrous oxide (N2O), CH4, CFCs, and other halocarbons. CFCs are chemically very stable compounds in the troposphere and have half-lives from tens of years to over hundreds of years. One of the sinks for CFCs is** transport to the stratosphere**, where shortwave UV radiation photo-dissociates the molecules, releasing chlorine (Cl) atoms. When in excess, these Cl atoms decrease the steady state stratospheric ozone concentration, in turn increasing the penetration of harmful UV radiation to the earth’s surface. 有几种气体似乎在空气中积累，其测量结果表明浓度逐年增加。如CO2、一氧化二氮（N2O）、CH4、CFC等卤代烃。 氟氯化碳是对流层中化学上非常稳定的化合物，半衰期从几十年到几百年。 氟氯化碳的一个汇是传输到平流层，在那里短波紫外线辐射将分子光解离，释放出氯（Cl）原子。当过量时，这些Cl原子降低稳态平流层臭氧浓度，进而增加有害紫外线辐射对地球表面的渗透。 Oxidation, either atmospheric or biological, is a prime removal mechanism for inorganic as well as organic gases. Inorganic gases, such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and sulfur trioxide (SO3), may eventually form corresponding acids: Oxidation of SO2 is slow in a mixture of pure gases, but the rate is increased by light, NO2, oxidants, and metallic oxides which act as catalysts for the reaction. The formed acids can react with PM or ammonia to form salts, such as sulphate and nitrate. 大气或生物氧化是无机和有机气体的主要去除机理。 无机气体，如一氧化氮（NO）、二氧化氮（NO2）、硫化氢（H2S）、二氧化硫（SO2）、三氧化硫（SO3），最终可能形成相应的酸： 在纯气体的溷合物中，SO2的氧化速度较慢，但其速率由光促進、NO2、氧化剂和作为反应催化剂的金属氧化物增加。 形成的酸可以与PM或氨反应生成盐，如硫酸盐和硝酸盐。 2.0.8 Receptors A receptor is something that is adversely affected by polluted air. A receptor may be a person or animal that breathes the air and whose health may be adversely affected thereby, or whose tissue may be irritated, or whose surfaces (e.g. skin, leaf cover, roof) may be coated or discolored. Some properties of the atmosphere itself, such as its ability to transmit radiant energy, may be affected. Aquatic life in lakes and some soils are adversely affected by acidification via acidic deposition. 2.0.9 Transport and Dispersion Transport is the mechanism that moves the pollution from a source to a receptor. The wind is the means by which the pollution is transported from the source to the receptor. During its transit over the 5 mile between the source and the receptor, the plume does not remain a cylindrical tube of pollution of the same diameter as the interior of the stack from which it was emitted. If the wind speed is greater than the speed of ejection from the stack, the wind will stretch out the plume until the plume speed equals wind speed. The sum of all these processes is called diffusion. Dispersion is the preferred term when discussing atmospheric transport at a scale larger than molecular. If the plume carrying air pollutants is above the height where ground-based convective and turbulent processes will bring it down to the ground reasonably close to its origin, it may travel for hundreds of miles at that height before being brought to earth by these processes in a remote community. This is known as** long-range or long-distance transport**. 2.0.10 Polluted Atmosphere The same chemical compounds or particles from a natural source (e.g. a volcano) elicit the same adverse effects as when they are emitted by anthropogenic sources. The source does not define air pollution. The receptor is a better reference point for determining whether air is polluted or unpolluted. (Examples). Unpolluted air is merely a benchmark to show the extent and trends of air pollution. Governments around the world have established and are continuously evaluating the impact of elevated levels of myriad gases and particulate material in the atmosphere. (Visibility, health, ecosystems, buildings and structures) 来自天然来源（如火山）的相同化合物或颗粒所产生的不利影响与来自人为来源的化学化合物或颗粒所产生的不利影响相同。 来源没有界定空气污染。该受体是确定空气是被污染还是未被污染的一个更好的参考点。（例子）。 未受污染的空气仅仅是表明空气污染程度和趋势的基准。世界各国政府已经建立并不断评估大气中无数气体和颗粒物含量升高的影响。（能见度、健康、生态系统、建筑物和构筑物） A substance is an air pollutant only in amounts which could be harmful to the health or comfort of humans and animals or which could cause damage to plants and materials”. When a substance is deemed to be an air pollutant, the governments are compelled to set standards and to require prevention, control, and other actions to decrease the pollution to a concentration considered acceptable. Air pollutants are a type of “contaminant”, which implies that something must be cleaned up. Contamination is also a term that is applied differently by scientists and the general public, as well as among scientists from different disciplines. 物质是一种空气污染物，其含量可能对人和动物的健康或舒适有害，或可能对植物和材料造成损害。” 当一种物质被视为空气污染物时，各国政府被迫制定标准，要求采取预防、控制和其他行动，将污染降低到被认为可以接受的浓度。 空气污染物是一种”污染物”，意味着必须清理一些东西。 污染也是科学家和公众以及来自不同学科的科学家以不同方式使用的术语。 Public health is usually the principal driver for assessing and controlling environmental contaminants, but ecosystems are also important receptors of contaminants (i.e. acid rain). Contaminants are not limited to abiotic chemical substances, but can be biological (viruses, molds, etc.) and physical, such as the energy from ultraviolet (UV) light. 公共卫生通常是评估和控制环境污染物的主要驱动力，但生态系统也是污染物（即酸雨）的重要受体。 污染物不限于非生物化学物质，而可以是生物（病毒、霉菌等）和物理的，例如来自紫外线（UV）光的能量。 "],["w02_0301.html", "Chapter 3 W02_0301 3.1 Air Pollution Decision Tools– Introduction 3.2 Air Pollution Decision Tools– Interpreting Data 3.3 Expressions of Air Pollution Risk 3.4 Causal Links between Risk Factors and Adverse Outcomes 3.5 Biologic Gradient 3.6 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Systems Context for Air Pollution 3.7 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Energy 3.8 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Energy Life Cycles 3.9 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Environmental Justice during Extraction 3.10 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Fuel Cycle Impacts 3.11 空氣污染氣象學", " Chapter 3 W02_0301 3.1 Air Pollution Decision Tools– Introduction Air pollution results from myriad sources and processes. This information must be evaluated and integrated to inform decision makers as to the best approaches for addressing the problems presented by polluted air. The information in the figure indicates that air pollution is not a single variable, linear relationship between sources and receptors. Indeed, activities that one may assume would increase emissions, such as increased energy consumption and vehicle miles travelled, were accompanied by substantial decreases in the emissions of criteria air pollutants. The relationships between risk from air pollutants and sources can only properly be explained systematically. That is, the harm that results from air pollution is a product of the life cycle of pollution. Air pollution is an outcome of the steps that involve energy and various types of matter, both living and non-living. The life cycle includes not only time in the air, but also time in the water, on the land, in the soil, and within organisms. The emission of an agent is only one part of the life cycle. Indeed, it is not even the beginning, since certain processes always precede the emission. environmental and health policies are made from two broad perspectives: evidence-based risk assessments. Precaution. For evidence-based decisions, the onus is mainly placed on proving that a product or process causes harm, whereas in precaution-based decision making, the onus is placed on proving something is safe or will not cause harm. The precaution usually includes an element of irreversibility, i.e. even a slight chance that an agent will cause irreversible harm would lead to a decision not to allow the agent, or at least only allow it at levels below which there is strong scientific information showing no harm. Both evidence-based and precaution-based decisions require the analysis of substantial amounts of data. Evidence-based risk assessments require information regarding both the hazard and the likelihood of exposure to that hazard. Thus, if this information is scarce or unreliable, the risk assessment is useless at best and dangerous at worst, since it either underestimates or overestimates the risk. For problems that may affect large numbers of people, large geographic areas, and/or that are irreversible, precaution is in order. This is the basis for factors of safety in engineering design and prudence. Therefore, precaution applies to global scale air pollution, such as the long-range transport of pollutants, acid rain, and climate change (Figure). One of the arguments for taking actions to address climate change is that climate change could be irreversible (given the long wait for sufficient evidence) and that under many predicted scenarios such change likely would lead to widespread and severe damage to public health and ecosystems. The ecological effects include loss of diversity and productivity. Some habitats are particularly vulnerable to irreversibility. The understanding of the factors that lead to a risk is called risk analysis; whereas the reduction of this risk (e.g. by wearing helmet and staying on bike paths) is known as risk management. Risk management, including the policies, laws, and other societal aspects of risk, is often differentiated from risk assessment, which comprises the scientific considerations of a risk. Air pollution risk is increased in two very basic ways. The mix of substances may become inherently more harmful; or the amount of exposure to harmful substances may increase. The former is an increase in the hazard and the latter is an increase in exposure. Air pollution actions must be based on reliable risk analysis and assessment. 3.2 Air Pollution Decision Tools– Interpreting Data Events can be characterized in a number of ways. Events may be discrete or continuous. Events can also be independent or dependent. Since air pollution usually involves numerous variables, joint probabilities are also calculated. For n mutually exclusive events as possible outcomes from E that have probabilities equal to P{Ei}, the probability of these events in a trial equals the sum of the individual probabilities: \\(P(E_1 or E_2 \\ldots,or E_k) = P(E_1)+P(E_2)+\\cdots,+P(E_3)\\) Further this helps us to find the probabilities of events ei and gi for two independent sets of events, E and G, respectively: \\(P(e_i and g_i) = P(e_i)P(g_i)\\) For example, a company record book indicates that a waste site has 10 unlabelled buried chemical drums. However, the drums were originally colour coded according to the vapor pressures (P) of the contents: five drums that contain a low vapor pressure (P0 = 10-6 kPa) substance (Plow), two drums that contain a medium vapor pressure (P0 = 10-4 kPa) substance (Pmed), and three drums that contain a very high vapor pressure (P0 = 10-1 kPa) substance (Pvh). To remove the Plow and Pmed drums before calling in special equip teams for the Plow drums that, if ruptured, would release the contents into the air more rapidly. We can determine the probability of pulling up one of the drums that contains substances with a low or medium vapor pressure (i.e. Plow and Pmed). The two possible events (Plow drum or Pmed drum) then, are mutually exclusive and come from the same sample space Thus we have a 70% probability of pulling up a drum with a low to moderate vapor pressure substance. Following the above, A nearby waste site also has 10 unlabelled, buried drums, but with known chemical formulations: three drums that contain dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and seven drums that contain trichloromethane (CHCl3). If there is a possibility that the Pmed substance could be very dangerous in the presence of CHCl3, and the need for special measures to segregate the Pmed and CHCl3. To know the probability of pulling up a Pmed drum from the first site and a CHCl3 drum from the second site. Since the two trials are independent, it can be calculated as Thus we have 6% probability of extracting a medium vapor pressure substance drum and a dichloromethane drum on our first excavation. Thus, there will be a 6% probability of this scenario, unless other steps are taken (e.g. conducting removals on different days) Another important concept for environmental data is that of conditional probability. If we have two dependent sets of events, E and G, the probability that event ek will occur if the dependent event g has previously occurred is shown as p{ek | g}, which is found using Baye’s theorem: A review of this equation shows that conditional probabilities are affected by a cascade of previous events. Thus, the probability of what happens next can be highly dependent upon what has previously occurred. For example, the cumulative risk of cancer depends on the serial (dependent) outcomes. Similarly, reliability can also be affected by dependencies and prior events. Thus, characterizing any risk or determining the reliability of systems are expressions, at least in part, of probability. Air pollution data can also be presented by a “probability density function” (PDF) for data. The PDF is created from a probability density; when the data are plotted in the form of a histogram, as the amount of data increases, the graph increases its smoothness, i.e. the data appear to be continuous. The smooth curve can be expressed mathematically as a function, f(x), which is the PDF. The probability distribution can take many shapes, so the f(x) for each distribution will differ accordingly. For example, in environmental matters, distributions commonly seen are normal, log-normal, and Poisson. The normal (Gaussian) distribution is symmetrical and is best known as the “bell curve”, given its shape (as right Figure). The log-normal distribution is also symmetrical, but its x-axis is plotted as a logarithm of the values. The Poisson distribution is a representation of events that happen with relative infrequency, but regularly. The Poisson distribution function expresses the probability of observing various numbers of a particular event in a sample when the mean probability of that event in any one trial is very small. So, the Poisson probability distribution characterizes discrete events that occur independently of one another during a specific period of time. This is useful for risk assessments, since exposure-related measurements can be expressed as a rate of discrete events, i.e. the number of times an event happens during a defined time interval, such as the frequency (times per week) that a person drives a car. The Poisson distribution describes events that take place during a fixed period of time (i.e. a rate), so long as the individual events are independent of one another. The Poisson equation needed to compute the probability of a specific number of counts being observed over a defined time interval is where, λ - average or expected counts or events per unit time and n - number of encounters. Thus, the Poisson distribution is useful in a risk assessment to estimate exposures. It may be used to characterize the frequency with which a person (or animal or ecosystem) comes into contact with a substance. 3.3 Expressions of Air Pollution Risk Expressions of Air Pollution Risk An event (e) is one of the possible outcomes of a trial (drawn from a population). Risk is a probability. All probabilities, including risk, range from zero to unity, or are stated as a percentage, 0-100%. Risks in a population can be stated as the product of probability and an outcome. This can be stated as a frequency (F) at which the adverse outcome occurs: where, X = number of adverse events; N = number of individuals in the population. For example, if 100 people contact a disease randomly distributed in a population of 100,000, frequency of the disease is 102/105 = 10-3, or one in a thousand. The F term is usually referred to as a probability (P). Air pollution studies often compare populations, e.g. workers exposed to a particular air pollutant compared to the general population. This comparison is known as a relative risk (RR), which is calculated as RR for air pollutants is often stated as a ratio, particularly as a standard mortality ratio or a standard morbidity ratio (both abbreviated to “SMR”): where, D = number of deaths for standardized mortality rates or number of diseases for standardized morbidity rates. For example, if 15 out of 10,000 workers who are exposed to air polluted with a metallic compound have died of a type of lung cancer that occurs at a rate of 15 per million, the SMR for this hypothetical cohort of exposed workers would be 15(104)-1 / 15 (106) -1 = 102. This means that the worker’s RR is 100 times that of the general population of dying from this particular type of cancer. The SMR is used as a specific measure of the strength of association between a population’s exposure to an air pollutant and deaths that may be attributed to that exposure. The mortality rate in a community without a specific exposure or intervention is called the baseline rate, which represents the expected level of the mortality. Note that the denominators in Eqs (4.7) and (4.8) include “unexposed” in their subscripts. Actually, these populations are seldom completely unexposed. Workplaces may differ from the general environment not only in the concentrations of certain pollutants, but also in the ways people are exposed. For example, the toxic metal cadmium (Cd) is a pollutant released during the production of batteries (especially, nickel-cadmium [NiCd] types), paints, and coatings, as well as during metal work, e.g. welding, soldering, and plating. Air concentrations of Cd in the workplace can be much higher than in the general environment. In the United States, inhalation is the major route of workplace exposure to Cd. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for Cd fumes or cadmium oxide (CdO) as 0.1 µg m-3 . 3.3.1 Risk Factors and Confounders Risk Factors and Confounders Another way to think about Ens (4.7) and (4.8) is that they show the difference between what is being observed versus what is expected in terms of death and disease. The denominator actually needs to be comparable from one study to the next, i.e. a “standard population” or “reference population”. So, the SMR is employed to compare mortality or morbidity risks of a study population to that of a standard population. The standard population may or may not be an unexposed population. For most air pollutants, the standard population is indeed exposed, but usually are much lower levels than the study group. However, the standard population may actually be more highly exposed to certain air pollutants, such as O3 indoor is usually much lower than that outdoor. 3.4 Causal Links between Risk Factors and Adverse Outcomes Air pollution decision making must infer causality. Risk of an adverse outcome is increased when risk factors are increased in number and size. Two essential attributes of a risk factor is its strength of association and its temporality. 3.4.1 Strength of Association How to associate a particular risk factor, especially an air pollutant, with an adverse outcome? Strong associations provide more certain evidence of causality than is provided by weak associations. Common epidemiological metrics used in association include risk ratio, odds ratio, and standardized mortality ratio. 3.4.2 Consistency Has [the association] been repeatedly observed by different persons, in different places, circumstances and times? Outcomes from laboratory-based and/or field work studies are consistent?! Consistency strengthens the link between exposure to an air pollutant and an adverse effect, e.g. lung cancer. Consider an air pollutant that is positive for mutagenicity, is linked to cancer in mouse and Rhesus monkey experiments, and for which human epidemiological studies show increased cancer incidence 3.4.3 Specificity The specificity criterion holds that the cause should lead to only one disease and that the disease should result from only this single cause. This is rarely the case in studying most chronic diseases, since a chemical can be associated with cancers in numerous organs, and the same chemical may elicit cancer, hormonal, immunological, and neural dysfunctions. In addition, non-chemical stressors may elicit the same chronic effects as chemicals, such as psychological stress and genetic disorders. Thus, for air pollution studies, specificity is not to be expected for many diseases. 3.4.4 Temporality Timing of exposure is critical to causality. For air pollutants, the exposure begins the disease progression process. If the disease occurs before the exposure, the pollutant cannot be considered a cause of the disease. Although the temporality is required for causality, it does not assure causality. That is, if the exposure to the air pollutant occurred after the onset of the disease, that study cannot be used as evidence linking the air pollutant to the disease However, if the exposure occurred prior to the disease, the study may be used, but only if other criteria support the causal link, since another agent or risk factor may be the actual cause of the disease (confounders). 3.5 Biologic Gradient Chemical hazard is usually determined from bioassays, animal studies, epidemiology, and models that generate a biological gradient, i.e. the higher the dose the greater the effect. This is known as the “dose-response” step in risk assessment. Dose-response curves point to thresholds above which air pollutant exposures are expected to elicit effects (e.g. above a “no observable adverse effect level”). Air pollution is hazardous to both human health and ecosystems, so the biological response may manifest itself as diseases and death in human populations and as damage to habitats and organisms living in ecosystems 3.5.1 Coherence All available evidence concerning the natural history and biology of the disease should “stick together” (cohere) to form a cohesive whole. For air pollution, temporal patterns of exposure and adverse effects must adhere to what is known about the associated biological effects. If animal data suggest that inhaling a substance leads to a respiratory effect, but human data do not, this is an example of lack of coherence. Lack of coherence may be the result of paucity of human data; Lack of coherence may also result from intraspecies differences for which human studies have not yet been properly designed; Lack of coherence, then, does not in itself eliminate a causal link. Conversely, if all studies are coherent, it very strongly suggests a causal link. 3.5.2 Experimentation Experimental evidence in support of a causal hypothesis may come in the form of community and clinical trials, in vitro and in vivo laboratory experiments, animal models, and natural experiments. The relationship between an air pollutant and an adverse outcome is usually multifaceted. Slight differences in chemistry, physical form, and biological makeup of the receptor organism cannot usually be duplicated with well-controlled experiments. Thus, the results are usually very specific to the independent and dependent variables in study and not easily extrapolated to actual, real-world situations. 3.6 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Systems Context for Air Pollution Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one increasingly useful and reliable tool for air pollution decision making. Air pollution must be understood systematically and includes steps that involve energy and various types of matter, both living and nonliving. The life cycle perspective avoids arbitrary divisions among air pollution, water pollution, land pollution, and the like. The fundamentals include a sound basis for designing and selecting the appropriate air pollution control equipment or understanding the chemical reactions that lead to the emission of air pollutants. Energy production is a major source of air pollution. Energy concerns are at the forefront of political, policy, and scientific decisions. 3.7 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Energy Modern life depends on energy in all of its forms, including mechanical, thermal, chemical, acoustic, and nuclear energy. Most of the earth’s available energy comes from the sun. The fusion and fission of the sun emits large amounts of electromagnetic radiation, some of which finds its way to the earth (i.e., sunlight). Plants use and store this energy by photosynthesis; Animals use the stored energy for respiration; The remains of these plants and animals are deposited, and under pressure and over vast periods of time, energy is captured in minerals, known as fossil fuels. The sun is also the source of many so-called alternative energy sources. Most obvious is solar energy. Wind is actually a type of solar energy, since the heating of the atmosphere leads to air movements. Bioenergy systems, e.g. algae and wood, are also solar, given that they derive their energy from photosynthesis and respiration. The only “nonsolar” energy source on the earth is nuclear energy; Radioactive elements have unstable nuclei that emit radiation as they decay. Choosing the best energy source is complicated. The most contentious and important are the public health and environmental impacts of the various energy sources. An electric car may appear to be much cleaner than a gasoline-powered car, based solely on tailpipe emissions. The comparison becomes more complicated when the major source of electricity is coal that, when burned, emits large amounts of pollution from a stationary source, i.e. the power plant. The best way to consider the air pollution impacts of energy production, distribution, and transport is to employ a life cycle assessment (LCA). In the electricity versus internal combustion example, the electric car system would emit large amounts of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and heavy metals (including mercury [Hg]) from a central source. Conversely, each gasoline-powered car would emit much smaller amounts of PM; volatile organic compounds (VOCs), like benzene; and other pollutants, but the overall emissions from millions of small mobile sources (vehicles) is what is important. 3.8 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Energy Life Cycles The environmental acceptability of any energy source must be evaluated systematically. This is demonstrated by the LCA (see Figure). Burning 100-L fuel A to manufacture 1000 kg of product Y releasing 100 kg of SO2 per year versus burning 150 L of fuel B to manufacture the same amount of product Z, but releasing 300 kg of SO2 per year. If this were the only criterion, fuel A would unquestionably be the best choice. It uses 50% less fuel (more energy efficient) and releases one-third of the pollutant. However, looking further back into the life cycle in Figure 5.1, It is found that fuel A requires that 1 t of earth is removed to produce 100 L of fuel A, but fuel B requires no extraction (it is generated from recycled food oils, e.g. biodiesel). It would appear that, early in the life cycle, fuel A has a much higher environmental cost (damage) than does fuel B. It could be that the extraction process does not emit a large amount of air pollutants, although such processes usually do, often in the form of fugitive dust (PM). Extraction activities almost always damage ecosystems, soil, and water systems. Furthermore, the two fuels will have different costs and benefits at the other levels. Spatial harm occurs when a contaminant is released into the environment and causes immediate harm within a defined distance of the release. For example, an atmospheric plume may be transported to places where it causes additional harm. Within the plume, chemical transformation may occur by abiotic and biotic processes to form new compounds, which may be more or less reactive and toxic and which may build up in the environment after they are deposited from the atmosphere. Temporal harm can take the form of short-term impacts.时间性伤害 A substance is released into the environment, rendering an immediate, acute impact. Such a response can range from the highly circumscribed with little impact (e.g. release of a highly reactive substance in sufficiently low quantities and distance between the release and the receptor, so that it breaks down long before causing any harm) to disastrous (an immediate release of sufficiently large quantities of a substance that reach the receptor and elicit effects to a large population of receptors). The insult may be either isolated or episodic (e.g. one-time event like thermal inversion during a confluence of events, such as an explosion, where large amounts of contaminants are released and remain for a protracted time period), or it may be continuous, e.g. a water heater that releases carbon monoxide due to inadequate air-to-gas ratios, a leak from a propane tank valve into the atmosphere, or a slow release of gasoline (benzeneetolueneeethylbenzeneexylene) from an underground storage tank over decades into the groundwater and atmosphere. The top box in Figure 5.2 includes emissions from every step in the energy life cycle, from extraction (e.g. PM from mining and volatilization of compounds from crude oil and natural gas extraction) to releases of air pollutants from refining and processing to emissions from vehicles and other sources during combustion to releases from landfills, incinerators, recycling, and other end-of-life systems. Mass must be balanced. 3.8.1 Upstream Impacts Every energy source has upstream impacts. Coal and uranium must be mined, crude oil and natural gas drilled, and trees harvested. This also extends to “non-emitting” sources. Construction of materials extracted from the earth. After extraction, the manufacturing processes are also part of the upstream stage of the life cycle for all energy sources, i.e., decentralized system, wind turbines installed on buildings, as well as related facility. The footprint of these large systems can be substantial in terms of time, materials, and energy demands. 3.9 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Environmental Justice during Extraction A complete LCA consideration must include societal factors. A particularly illustrative example is justice. “Environmental justice” communities have two characteristics: They have experienced historical (usually multigenerational) exposures to disproportionately high doses of potentially harmful substances (the environmental part). They have certain specified socioeconomic and demographic characteristics 社会经济学和人口学特征, including a low SES; are racial and ethnic; and are historically a disadvantaged people. 3.10 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Fuel Cycle Impacts Some fuels are usable directly as extracted, e.g. natural gas and coal, but often need to be changed physically to aid transport and combustion. The natural gas may be compressed for ease in cross-oceanic transport. Coal will be crushed and even pulverized, depending on the combustion requirements. Processing uranium ore into usable fuel may require large amounts of energy, often from fossil fuels. Thus, even though the nuclear reactions themselves produce no greenhouse gases or other pollutants, the processing steps certainly will. 3.10.1 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants– Operation Stage After extraction and fuel processing, each energy system is operated over its design life. During this life, fossil fuels are burned, nuclear reactions occur, and biota grow. Combustion 燃烧（分解 The largest human-induced source of many air pollutants is the combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity. The principal contributor to Hg, CO2, and SO2 emissions has been coal-fired power plants. The interactions of ions in precipitation (i.e. H+, SO4-2 , NO3- ) with organic and inorganic constituents of soil and water affect toxicity. Particularly important is the leaching of potentially toxic elements, especially aluminum, from rocks and soils by acidic precipitation. Complete or efficient combustion (thermal oxidation) converts hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water: Combustion is the combination of O2 in the presence of heat (as in burning fuel), producing CO2 and H2O during complete combustion of organic compounds, such as the combustion of octane: Complete combustion may also result in the production of molecular nitrogen (N2) when nitrogen-containing organics are burned, such as in the combustion of methylamine Incomplete combustion can produce a variety of compounds. Some are more toxic than the original compounds being oxidized, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, furans, and CO. Incomplete combustion reactions are very important sources of air pollutants. 3.11 空氣污染氣象學 大氣對污染物的四種作用: 輸送作用: 風速、風向決定污染物輸送範圍及大小 擴散作用: 主要指垂直方向的擴散，與地表粗糙度、大氣穩定度及混合層高度有關。 轉化作用: 污染物質於大氣中因自身衰減或與其他污染物或受陽光照射之作用，發生化學變化。轉化成其他物質而造成二次污染，如光化學反應。 移除作用: 大氣中之污染物質因下列過程而從大氣中消失。 微粒物質因重力而沉降至地表 因降雨或降雪的洗除 被雪粒、水蒸氣包圍而成凝結核。 上述作用中，以輸送效應最大，而影響大氣輸送最主要的因子為盛行風(Praevailing Wind). 影響大氣中空氣污染物輸送與擴散之因子 大氣穩定度: 風速、風向、溫度梯度 (Temperature gradient)、日照、雲量等。 混合層高度: 定義為地面上受到亂流作用而使污染物得以擴散至混合的高度。 局部環流: 熱島效應、海陸風、下沖作用 氣壓與污染物之擴散 低壓地區常伴隨多雲且不穩定的天氣，風速亦較大，有利於污染物之擴散，其伴隨之雨水亦可移除大氣中之污染物。 高壓地區通常是晴朗穩定的天氣，風速亦較小，若有滯留高壓或沉降逆溫層的存在，則污染物之擴散及輸送均極不易，因此高污染事件好發於冬季。 3.11.1 風速與風向 風速 目前以計算有效煙囪高度處之風速，最簡便而常用的方法為利用風速冪次律(Power Law)。 風向 風向之定義為風的來向，通常將風向分為16個方位，並將逐時的風速大小描繪在該方向而形成風花圖(Wind Rose)。線條長短為風速出現的百分比。 3.11.2 大氣垂直溫度結構與安定度 溫降傾率(Lapse Rate) 當少量空氣在大氣層中向上移動，會因壓力降低而膨脹並降低溫度，通常該膨脹相當快速，可假設該氣團與周圍大氣間並未發生熱量轉移(假設為絕熱狀態)。 對一空氣圓柱，厚度差異dz所產生之靜態平衡如下: dP = - \\(\\rho gdz\\) (2-2) 3.11.3 大氣溫降傾率與大氣穩定性之關係 Weak Lapse Rate – Weakly stable 大氣之盛行溫降傾率小於乾絕熱溫降傾率 (1)當氣團從C上升至A，氣團溫度T1低於大氣環境溫度T2，故氣團將在下降(因溫度低，密度較大，下降) (2)氣團由C下降至B，氣團溫度T4高於大氣環境溫度T3，故氣團將在上升(因溫度高，密度較小，上升) (3)此狀態為一穩定狀態，限制了氣團垂直運動，妨礙上下混合作用。 Strong Lapse Rate – Unstable 大氣之盛行溫降傾率大於乾絕熱溫降傾率。 (1)當氣團從C上升至A，氣團溫度T2高於大氣環境溫度T1，故氣團將繼續上升。 (2)氣團由C下降至B，氣團溫度T3低於大氣環境溫度T4，故氣團將繼續下降。 (3)此狀態大氣垂直對流旺盛，利於污染物之擴散，系統為不穩定。 Neutral Stable 大氣之盛行溫降傾率等於乾絕熱溫降傾率。 氣團受外力後才有升降動作，若外力消失，則此氣團安定於新的位置，稱為中性穩定或隨意穩定。 結論 溫降傾率與大氣穩定性的關係如右圖 3.11.4 溫層逆轉 當高度升高時，氣溫亦隨之上升，亦即溫暖空氣在冷空氣上面，為一種弱溫降傾率之極端現象，空氣污染物無法向上擴散。 輻射性逆轉(Radiation Inversion) 在良好氣候下，因陽光照射使地面溫度較高，藉由對流作用，氣溫高之空氣向上升，形成遞減現象；但在夜間，地面之熱能向較冷的天空輻射，地表溫度急速冷卻而上層空氣未循比例冷卻，稱為輻射逆轉。因其高度約在200公尺以下，故又稱為接地逆轉，隨著早晨日照之開始，逆轉消失。 沉降性逆轉(Subsidence Inversion) 在高氣壓圈內，由於反旋風空氣之沉降，圈內空氣向外側吹，上層空氣沉降遞補，因絕熱壓縮，故沉降之空氣溫度會上升，因而形成逆轉。 地形性逆轉 在谷地中，由於冷空氣沿著地表流入谷底之結果，使得空氣約接近地面溫度越低，越往上則溫度越高。於夜間又與輻射逆轉結合在一起，使逆轉更加擴大。 3.11.5 大氣安定度與煙柱型態（氣象學的部分和空氣污染有關） 煙柱之擴散與大氣之溫降傾率有關，煙柱之形狀可作為判定大氣條件是否安定之依據 3.11.6 地形與地理位置對煙流型態之影響 溫暖而乾燥之區域(易輻射) 上午易發生燻煙型 (Fumigation) 下午傍晚，地面逆轉層易於形成，由煙囪高度(hs)決定煙流型態 Hs &gt;= 逆轉層高度 - 屋頂型(Lofting) Hs &lt;=逆轉層高度 – 扇形(Faning)或侷煙型(Trapping) 多雲而潮濕區域 盛行溫降傾率通常為濕絕熱型態(Wet Adiabatic Rate)，屬於弱溫降傾率(Weak Lapse Rate)的圓錐形(Coning)較常見。 多雲的情況下 地面之輻射逆轉層不易形成。 3.11.7 混合層高度 基於地表因受熱而在垂直方向產生強烈的混合，並將熱量傳輸給大氣，其伸展至某高度直到受到逆溫層所阻擋，此高度即為混合層高度。 在混合層內，污染物所能垂直混合的上限高度即為混合層高度，主要決定於亂流混合的強度(與風速、風向、地面粗糙度、太陽照射、及大氣垂直溫度結構有關)。 1. 混合層高度最大值一般發生在午後2-3點，為排放氣體最佳時機 2. 混合層高度最小值一般發生在清晨5-6點。 3.11.8 局部環流對污染物的影響 熱島效應 (Heat Island): 由於鄉村與都市溫度差引起之局部環流。 由於都市之輻射程度較鄉村劇烈，都市上空有上升氣流，利於污染物之擴散及稀釋。然而，在夜間至日出之間，由於穩定度增加，阻止環流產生，使污染物靜止懸浮於都市上空，日出後都市上空之污染物阻止輻射熱之吸收，鄉村之增溫率較大，形成由鄉村吹向都市之局部環流，而都市上空則有下降氣流，不利污染物擴散，故在都會區晨間運動應盡量在日出前。 海陸風 (Land-Sea Circulation): 發生在海陸交界，以24小時為週期之一種空氣局地環流，因陸地與海洋熱力性質差異所引起。 白天時，因陸地地面之比熱較海水小(陸地加熱和冷卻速率都比水快)，故陸地上之空氣上升而海面上的空氣下降，形成海風環流而將海面上的污染物吹向內陸，增加地面污染。反之夜間形成陸風循環，將都市內污染物吹向海上，減輕地面污染。 下沖作用 (Down Wash): 氣流遇障礙物而在其背風處造成氣流的下降。下沖作用有以下兩種: 氣流遇障礙物而在其背風處造成細流的下沖 空氣動力效應引起之下沖作用，即廢氣之排放速度小於煙囪口之盛行風速，煙流未即上升即迅速被往下帶。當廢氣排放速度與風速比值大於1.5時，即可避免。 山谷風(Mountain-Valley Wind) 因地形造成的局部環流，除了海陸風以外，另一種為山谷風，也是由不同冷卻程度所產生。在夜間，山谷中高度較高的地方其溫度較低，故空氣在夜間將流下到谷底，谷底的氣團被其上方的暖空氣困住，直到次日中午，股中空氣才有足夠熱量使逆轉瓦解。 海陸風及山谷風在氣象學上對空氣污染相當重要，因大型火力發電廠通常設在海岸或大湖附近。此情況下，煙囪之排放物在白天將由海風帶向內陸上空。而山谷中之污染源，白天煙柱將沿山谷上升，而晚上風吹向谷底，使煙柱由回到谷底，污染物濃度可能會累積到危險的程度 做都市規劃之時，應該先瞭解氣象條件！ 老師説不要退選啦XD "],["w03_0308.html", "Chapter 4 W03_0308 4.1 光化學烟霧", " Chapter 4 W03_0308 Scale and Complexity of Air Pollution– Introduction Air pollution exists at all scales, from personal to global. Ambient air pollution scales may be further subdivided into local, urban, regional, continental, and global. The spheres of influence of the air pollutants themselves range from molecular (e.g. gases and nanoparticles) to planetary (e.g. dispersion of greenhouse gases throughout the troposphere). The spatial extent of the local scale is a radius of up to about 5 km on the earth’s surface. The urban scale extends the radius to about 50 km. The regional scale radius is from 50 to 500 km. Continental scales are from 500 to several 1000 km in any direction, but is often the direction of the winds aloft, since this the route traversed by the pollutant. The global scale extends worldwide. Environmental engineering has a slightly different perspective of fate. Engineers employ remediation reactions, such as thermal and mechanical separation processes, as well as abiotic chemical reactions, such as precipitation and hydrolysis, as well as biological processes, such as microbial metabolic biochemical reactions, to break down toxic substances into simpler, less toxic compounds. The same processes and reactions that occur in the ambient environment mentioned in the previous paragraph are used by engineers for the treatment and control processes that usually fall under the category of environmental engineering. Engineers have simply changed the scale from large environmental compartments like air masses and lakes to smaller reactors, such as pollutant collection and treatment devices Recall that a fluid is a collective term that includes all liquids and gases. A liquid is matter that is composed of molecules that move freely among themselves without separating from each other. A gas is matter composed of molecules that move freely and are infinitely able to occupy the space with which they are contained at a constant temperature. A fluid is a substance that will deform continuously upon the application of a shear stress; i.e. a stress in which the material on one side of a surface pushes on the material on the other side of the surface with a force parallel to the surface. Fluids(流體) are generally divided into two types: ideal and real. The ideal has zero viscosity and, thus, no resistance to shear (explained below). An ideal fluid is incompressible and flows with uniform velocity distributions. It also has no friction between moving layers and no turbulence (i.e. eddy currents). On the contrary, a real fluid has finite viscosity, has nonuniform velocity distributions, is compressible, and experiences friction and turbulence. Real fluids are further subdivided according to their viscosities. A Newtonian fluid is one that has a constant viscosity at all shear rates at a constant temperature and pressure. Water and most solvents are Newtonian fluids. However, environmental engineers are confronted with non-Newtonian fluids, i.e. those with viscosities not constant at all shear rates. Sites contaminated with drilling fluids and oils have large quantities of non-Newtonian fluids onsite. One of the concepts of the particle is a theoretical point that has mass and location, but no geometric extension. Particle can be observed as it moves within the fluid as a representation of where that portion of the fluid is going and at what velocity. Another spatial and thermodynamic concept is the control volume, which is an arbitrary region in space that is defined by boundaries. The control volume’s boundaries may be either stationary or moving. The control volume is a means of applying the first law of thermodynamics, i.e. conservation of mass and energy. The amount of mass or energy entering a control volume must equal the amount exiting the control volume plus what remains in the control volume. The control volume is useful in measuring and modelling the amount of an air pollutant entering, remaining, and exiting a parcel of air, water, soil, or even a cell or parcel of tissue in an organism Contaminant transport requires motion. This highlights the need of understanding the spatial context and complexity of not only the air pollutant, but of the fluid behavior. The forces acting on a fluid may be body forces or surface forces. The former are forces that act on every particle within the fluid, occurring without actually making physical contact, such as gravitational force. The latter are forces that are applied directly to the fluid’s surface by physical contact. Stress represents the total force per unit area acting on a fluid at any point within the fluid volume. So, stress at any point P is Where, Fluid properties are characteristics of the fluid that are used to predict how the fluid will react when subjected to applied forces. If a fluid is considered to be infinitely divisible, that is, it is made up of many molecules that are constantly in motion and colliding with one another, this fluid is in continuum. Assuming that a fluid is a continuum allows for the fluid’s properties to be functions of position and time. Fluid properties are important at every scale of air pollution. Fluid properties must be considered at the cellular scale, e.g. flow through cell membranes. Such fluid properties can be represented by two fields. The density field is represented by: \\[\\rho = \\rho(x,y,z,t)\\] Where \\[\\begin{align} a_1 &amp;= \\beta_0 \\tag{4.1} \\\\ b_1 &amp;= \\beta_1 \\\\ c_1 &amp;= \\beta_2 \\\\ d_1 &amp;= \\beta_3 \\end{align}\\] The other fluid field is the velocity field: 臭氧，能夠和光發生反應， 臭氧層是指地球大氣層的平流層中臭氧濃度相對較高的部分，主要作用是吸收短波紫外線。 臭氧在平流層能夠對我們產生保護作用 。 但是臭氧在對流層就會對環境、人類健康產生不好的影響。 所謂空氣污染的概念，就是人類所界定的，在一定的條件之下會對環境、人產生危害的物質。 NO2與O3之關係 理論上O3之濃度為NO2起始濃度的函數，10 ppm的NO2，大約會有2.7 ppm之O3產生。 但事實上，NO2濃度通常不大於10 ppm，而O3濃度可大於2.7ppm，甚至經常可達到50 ppm。 某些相關機制使NO氧化成NO2而不消耗O3，使得O3逐漸累積。 4.1 光化學烟霧 光化學煙霧中刺激物之形成 醛的形成 醛類對眼睛具刺激性。 過氧硝酸乙醯酯(PAN, Peroxyl Acetyl Nitrate)的形成 PBN (Peroxyl Benzoyl Nitrite) 其對眼睛之刺激較PAN強100倍。 酸霧形成 此外SO2經過波長2900到4000Å可見光作用下，也可發生光化學反應而形成SO3。 光化學煙霧之污染過程 4.1.1 Photochemical smog  First identified in Los Angeles in 1944. Although several other kinds of smog occur, photochemical smog (or Los Angeles-type smog) is a yellow-brown haze produced by the reaction of sunlight with exhaust from automobiles and power plants that burn coal. Ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and other volatile organic compounds that make up this smog irritate eyes and nasal passages. Particularly dangerous to people who have heart disease, asthma, or other respiratory illnesses, and to anyone who exercises or does manual labor outdoors when smog is heavy. 有顏色，很嚴重，但不代表沒有顏色就不嚴重 區域性的臭氧的問題 要結合公衛、流病和觀測的方法、長期的分析 PAN為強烈眼睛刺激物，並能傷害植物 "],["w04_0315.html", "Chapter 5 W04_0315 5.1 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Transformation– Chemical Transformation 5.2 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Transformation– Kinetics 5.3 Air Pollution Physics and Chemistry 5.4 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Transformation– Rate Laws and Air Pollution Thermodynamics 5.5 Free Energy 5.6 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Transformation – Atmospheric Transformation 5.7 溫室效應與臭氧層破壞的問題 5.8 氣體中污染物濃度之測定", " Chapter 5 W04_0315 5.1 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Transformation– Chemical Transformation The extent and severity of air pollution begins with an understanding of the inherent properties of the agent, i.e. the air pollutant. The agent’s properties are key to the conditions under which it will be transformed chemically as it forms within sources, moves to the atmosphere, and reaches its fate in the environment. Chemical transformation of an air pollutant considers more than atmospheric transformation. The most obvious stage of the air pollutant’s life cycle is its residence in the atmosphere. The stages before and after its atmospheric presence must also be understood, for example, to prevent air pollution before it happens. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an air pollutant that can be produced in a number of ways. If the source is combustion, the best means of preventing its formation occurs in the combustion process (using fuel with lower concentrations of sulfur). If it occurs as a result of the release of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by anaerobic bacteria in sediment, which is subsequently transformed to SO2 in surface waters and the atmosphere, the prevention and controls would be different (e.g. increasing the oxygen content of the sediment to eliminate the anaerobes) Although the resulting atmospheric concentrations of SO2 might be equal in both scenarios described in the previous paragraph (Figure 17.1), the transformations leading to these concentrations are quite different. In the first, the oxidation by combustion leads to the production of SO2 that is emitted directly to the atmosphere. In the second, sulfur compounds are formed in a low oxygen, reduced environment that releases a reduced form of sulfur, which is then oxidized abiotically in the atmosphere. The SO2 that is directly released to the atmosphere was already in an oxidized state, so it may remain in that form or be further oxidized. If the fate is the human body or that of another organism, transformations continue in what is known as toxico-kinetics, i.e. biochemical reactions or bio-transformations that occur as a result of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a substance. If the fate is an ecosystem or a habitat within the ecosystem, both abiotic and biotic transformations occur, depending on the conditions. Even if the fate is a material, such as part of a building or other structure, kinetics continue, e.g. a deposited sulfate compound may react with the calcium carbonate or metal in a bridge, causing corrosion and ultimately placing the driving public at risk. The inherent physical and chemical properties dictate some of these transformations, which can often be characterized using analytical tools, such as the quantitative structure activity relationship. Molecular weight, polarity (結核), and molar volume are fundamental properties that are directly ascertained from the chemical structure. These drive other inherencies important to air pollution, especially aqueous solubility, vapor pressure, and dissociation constant. The two properties that are always important in environmental and atmospheric transformation are solubility and vapor pressure, which have been described as saturation properties. That is, they are expressions of the maximum amount of the chemical that can be held in the liquid (solubility) and gas (vapor pressure) phases. These inherent properties combine with others to make a chemical compound comparatively susceptible to environmental transformation or degradation, especially decomposition by photons (photochemical decomposition)（光子、光解）, water (hydrolysis), and energy transfer in organisms (biotic decomposition) Each chemical compound has a unique residence time or half-life (t1/2) within each compartment. It should be noted that t1/2, which is commonly used to indicate chemical and environmental persistence, is merely analogous, but not equal to the constant halflife of a radioisotope. The t1/2 for chemicals in the environment is a function of inherent properties and environmental conditions. All chemical transformations depend on temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, radical concentrations (especially hydroxyl), substrate (including water content and porosity), oxidation and reduction states, oxygen content, and microbial abundance and diversity. The t1/2 is highly variable by compartment and by season of the year. Aromatic compounds with several halogen substitutions are highly lipophilic, so these compounds are likely to become dissolved in any organic solvents present in the soil or in a storage tank, rendering them more mobile. Conversely, these same compounds are less likely to come into contact with reactive substances in the absence of these organic solvents. Likewise, if oxygen molecules or radicals are present in abundance, oxidation reactions are likely; whereas, if oxygen is scarce, reduction reactions are expected. How molecules are absorbed to and desorbed from substrate and matrix surfaces also affects the extent of chemical transformation, i.e. tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin is almost nonreactive in certain soils since the molecules are tightly bound to abundant sorption site (one reason dioxin-contaminated soils are so difficult to treat; requiring large amounts of heat energy for desorption from soil surfaces). 有几个卤素取代的芳香族化合物具有高度的亲油性，因此这些化合物很可能会溶解在土壤中或储罐中的任何有机溶剂中，从而使它们具有更大的流动性。 相反，在没有这些有机溶剂的情况下，这些相同的化合物不太可能与反应性物质接触。 同样，如果氧分子或自由基大量存在，就有可能发生氧化反应；而如果氧气稀少，预计会发生还原反应。 分子如何被基质和基体表面吸收和解吸也会影响化学转化的程度，例如，四氯二苯并对二恶英在某些土壤中几乎没有反应，因为分子与丰富的吸附点紧密结合（二恶英污染的土壤如此难以处理的原因之一；需要大量的热能来从土壤表面解吸）。 Type and amount of energy also dictates the kinds and rates of chemical transformation. If sunlight is abundant, photochemical reactions may occur. Oxidation and reduction (i.e. redox) reactions may occur if aerobic and anaerobic microbes are present, respectively, as these organisms accept and donate electrons for energy transfer. Transport and transformation determine a contaminant’s fate in the environment. Figure (next slide) shows how a chemical compound’s transport, transformation, and fate lead to air pollution risk to human populations and ecosystems. 能量的类型和数量也决定了化学转化的种类和速度。如果阳光充足，可能会发生光化学反应。 如果有好氧和厌氧微生物存在，就可能发生氧化和还原（即氧化还原）反应，因为这些生物接受和捐献电子进行能量转移。 运输和转化决定了污染物在环境中的命运。 图（下一张幻灯片）显示了一个化合物的运输、转化和转归如何导致空气污染对人类和生态系统的风险。 5.2 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Transformation– Kinetics Chemical kinetics is the description of the rate of a chemical reaction. Since a rate is a change in quantity that occurs with time, the change we are most concerned with is the change in the concentration of our contaminants into new chemical compounds: and When a compound breaks down, i.e. degrades, the change in product concentration will be decreasing proportionately with the reactant concentration. For substance A the kinetics is: The negative sign denotes that the reactant concentration (the parent contaminant) is decreasing. The degradation product C resulting from the concentration will be increasing in proportion to the decreasing concentration of the contaminant A, and the reaction rate for Y is: ∆(X) is calculated as the difference between an initial concentration and a final concentration: \\[\\Delta(X) = \\Delta(X)_{\\text{final}}- \\Delta(X)_{\\text{initial}}\\] Thus, the rate of reaction at any time is the negative of the slope of the tangent to the concentration curve at that specific time. For a reaction to occur, the molecules of the reactants must collide. High concentrations of a substance are more likely to collide than low concentrations. The reaction rate must be, therefore, a function of the concentrations of the reacting substances. In a reaction of reactants A and B to yield product C (i.e. A + B →C), the reaction rate increases in accordance with the increasing concentration of either A or B. If the amount of A is tripled, then the rate of this whole reaction triples. Thus, the rate law for such a reaction is: \\[Rate = k[A][B]\\] The rate law for the different reaction X + Y → Z, in which the rate is only increased if the concentration of X is increased (changing the Y concentration has no effect on the rate law), must be: \\[Rate = k[X]\\] Equations (17.6) and (17.7) indicate that the concentrations in the rate law are the concentrations of reacting chemical species at any specific point in time during the reaction. The rate is the velocity of the reaction at that time. The constant k in the equations is the rate constant, which is unique for every chemical reaction and is a fundamental physical constant for a reaction, as defined by environmental conditions (e.g. pH, temperature, pressure, type of solvent). The rate constant is the rate of the reaction when all reactants are present in a 1 molar (M) concentration. The rate constant k is the rate of reaction under conditions standardized by a unit concentration. The overall kinetic order is the sum of the exponents (powers) of all the concentrations in the rate law. For the rate k[A][B], the overall kinetic order is 2. Such a rate describes a second-order reaction because the rate depends on the concentration of the reactant raised to the second power. Other decomposition rates are like k[X], and are first-order reactions because the rate depends on the concentration of the reactant raised to the first power. K[A][B] is second-order for each reactant and k[X] is first-order X and zero-order for Y. In a zero-order reaction, compounds degrade at a constant rate and are independent of reactant concentration. 5.3 Air Pollution Physics and Chemistry Air pollution physics must be considered mutually with air pollution chemistry. Any complete discussion of the physical process of solubility, for example, must include a discussion of polarity. Any discussion of polarity must include a discussion of electronegativity. Discussions of sorption and air-water exchanges must consider both chemical and physical processes. Air pollution involves five categories of chemical reactions. Various types of reaction occur within boilers and other industrial operations; in stacks; in the plume; in the microenvironments and ecosystems; and within organisms. 5.3.1 Synthesis or Combination In combination reactions, two or more substances react to form a single substance: \\[A+B \\rightarrow AB\\] Two types of combination reactions are important in environmental systems, i.e. formation and hydration. Formation reactions are those where elements combine to form a compound. Examples include the formation of ferric oxide and the formation of octane: Hydration reactions involve the addition of water to synthesize a new compound, for example, when calcium oxide is hydrated to form calcium hydroxide, and when phosphate is hydrated to form phosphoric acid. 5.3.2 Decomposition \\[AB \\rightarrow A+B\\] Calcium carbonate breaks down into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide: CaCO3(s) \\(\\rightarrow\\) CaO(s)+CO2(g) Most decomposition reactions need energy added to the reaction. When electricity provides the energy, it is known as electrolysis. When photons provide the energy, it is known as photolysis. When microbes decompose an organic compound into simpler compounds, the process is known as biodegradation 5.3.3 Single Replacement A+BC \\(\\rightarrow\\) AC+B Single replacement (or single displacement) commonly occurs when one metal ion in a compound is replaced with another metal ion, such as when trivalent chromium replaces monovalent silver: 3AgNO3(aq)+Cr(s) \\(\\rightarrow\\) Cr(NO3)3(aq)+3Ag(s) 5.3.4 Double Replacement AB+CD \\(\\rightarrow\\) AD+CB 5.3.5 Complete Combustion Complete or efficient combustion (thermal oxidation) occurs when an organic compound is oxidized in the presence of heat (indicated by ∆): Combustion is the combination of O2 in the presence of heat (as in burning fuel) producing CO2 and H2O during complete combustion of organic compounds, such as the combustion of octane: Complete combustion may also result in the production of molecular nitrogen (N2) when nitrogen-containing organics are burned, such as in the combustion of methylamine: 5.4 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Transformation– Rate Laws and Air Pollution Thermodynamics Chemical transformation is explained by air pollution thermodynamics. Within the context of thermodynamics, a system is a sector or region in space or some parcel of a sector that has at least one substance that is ordered into phases. Reactors, stack gases, plumes, the open atmosphere, microenvironments, organisms and cells have qualities of both closed and open systems. A closed system does not allow material to enter or leave the system (engineers refer to a closed system as a “control mass”). The open system allows material to enter and leave the systems (such a system is known as a control volume). During airborne transport, an air pollutant may also undergo chemical changes. These changes may form toxic compounds or other types of problems, e.g. they may become stronger greenhouse gases. After deposition, chemical reactions occur in the soil, water, and biota. Thus, air pollutants are a mix of chemical reactions occurring at myriad rates. Air pollution seldom occurs in a single system. A better way to consider these mixed systems is pseudo orders in the rate laws, i.e. “pseudo-open” and “pseudo-closed” systems. Applying the qualifier “pseudo” to absolute terms is a good way to describe the actual rates that occur in the environment, as opposed to well-controlled laboratory experiments. The rate law for a chemical reaction is an equation that links the rate of the reaction with concentrations of reactants and rate constants (commonly, partial order reactions and rate coefficients). The rate is expressed as: Where k is the rate coefficient, the concentration of each chemical species are in brackets and the exponents are derived experimentally. A first-order reaction occurs at a linear rate: Similarly, a second-order reaction rate is: Or, The rate equations for third and next orders would follow the same format. In air pollution, numerous reactants are involved in reactions. Thus, mixed second order rate reactions can be expressed as: When reaction rates exceed first-order, the chemical concentrations can be adjusted so that the kinetics appears to be first-order. So, for the simple reaction 2A + B → C, the rate law would be: [B] changes extremely more slowly than the change in [A]. In this instance, Eq. (17.27) can be better written as: where k’ is a pseudo-first-order rate coefficient (units are inverse time, s-1 ). 5.5 Free Energy Free energy is the measure of a system’s ability to do work. If reactants in a reaction have greater free energy than the products, energy is released from the reaction; which means the reaction is exergonic. If the products from the reaction have more energy than the reactants, then energy is consumed; i.e. it is an endergonic reaction. Equilibrium constants can be ascertained thermodynamically by employing the Gibbs free energy (G) change for the complete reaction. This is expressed as: where G is the energy liberated or absorbed in the equilibrium by the reaction at constant T. H is the system’s enthalpy and S is its entropy. Enthalpy is the thermodynamic property expressed as: H=U+pV where U is the system’s internal energy. The relationship between a change in free energy and equilibria can be expressed by: \\[\\Delta G^* = \\Delta G^{*0}_f +RT \\ln K_{eq}\\] where ∆Gf*0 = free energy of formation at steady state (kJ g mol-1 ). The total energy in systems is known as enthalpy (H) and the usable energy is known as free energy (G). Living cells need G for all chemical reactions, especially cell growth, cell division, and cell metabolism and health. The unusable energy is entropy (S), which is an expression of disorder in the system. Disorder tends to increase as a result of the many conversion steps outside and inside of a system. 5.6 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Transformation – Atmospheric Transformation During their time in the atmosphere, chemical compounds generally become oxidized. Gases in reduced states undergo step reactions to form ionic substances, which are in turn washed out by rain and other precipitation, known in the atmospheric sciences as deposition. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a reduced species of sulfur. After emission to the atmosphere, it is dissolved in water vapor and is oxidized to form sulfate compounds or anions. For example, sulfate ions are formed when hydrogen sulfide is hydrolyzed: \\(\\require{mhchem}\\) \\(\\ce{H2OS(g) + H2O(l)-&gt;SO4^{2-} + 4H+ }\\) 5.6.1 Inorganic Reactions The inorganic chemical species is most important to atmospheric kinetics and transformation reactions can be grouped into five classifications: Odd oxygen species Odd hydrogen species Reactive nitrogen species Reactive sulfur species Reactive halogen species Odd oxygen species include O3, atomic O and O(1D), which is an O atom in an excited singlet state. Odd hydrogen species include OH, HO2, and atomic H. Reactive nitrogen species include NO, NO2, NO3, HNO2, HNO3, and NH3. Reactive sulfur species include SO2, SO3, H2SO3, H2SO4, and H2S. Reactive halogen species include F, FO, Cl, ClO, Br, BrO, I, IO, HCl, and Cl2. Solar radiation initiates the formation of free radicals. The internal energy of molecules is composed of electronic energy states. Molecules interact with solar radiation by absorbing photons, causing the molecule to undergo a transition from the ground electronic state to an excited state. The change in energy between the two states corresponds to a quantum or photon of solar radiation. The frequencies (v) of absorption are expressed by Planck’s law: \\[E = hv = hc/ \\lambda\\] where h is Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light, and v and λ are the frequency and wavelength of the light of the photon, respectively. The photon is represented as hv. Molecules and atoms interact with photons of solar radiation under certain conditions to absorb photons of light of various wavelengths. Each molecule absorbs solar radiation at its own range of wavelengths (right Table). An excited molecule can follow several pathways, including fluorescence, collisional deactivation, direct reaction, and photodissociation. Transformations occur by rate order. The photolytic reactions discussed in the next section include first-order reactions in the troposphere. For example, ozone is photolyzed to O(1D) and molecular oxygen: \\[\\ce{O3 + hv -&gt; O(1D) + O2}\\] This is an extremely important first-order transformation because the O(1D) is hydrolyzed in a second-order reaction to form OH, which is the most important oxidizing agent in the atmosphere: \\[\\ce{ O(1D) + H2O -&gt; 2OH}\\] Another first-order photolytic reaction occurs when nitrogen dioxide is converted to atomic oxygen and NO: \\[\\ce{ NO2 + hv -&gt; O + NO}\\] The atomic O leads to the production of ozone in the atmosphere when it combines with molecular oxygen and a relatively nonreactive molecule (M): \\[\\ce{ O + O2 + M -&gt; +O3 + M}\\] In the stratosphere, first-order reactions include photolysis of molecular oxygen and nitrous oxide, which yield the atomic O needed to form the ozone layer: \\[\\ce{ O2 +hv -&gt; +O +O}\\] Another important first-order reaction in the stratosphere is the photolytic transformation of greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, which slows its accumulation: \\[\\ce{ N2O +hv -&gt; +N2 +O(1D)}\\] Heterogeneous reactions in a rain drop can break down nitric acid in the gas phase during washout, producing nitrate and hydronium ions in the rainwater: \\[\\ce{ HNO3(g)-&gt;[\\ce{H2O(l)}] NO3^- +HNO+}\\] Second-order reactions are actually the most common type of atmospheric inorganic reaction, including the reactions of radicals, such as Eqn (17.36). Others include the transformation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the formation of HO2 and formation of nitrogen dioxide from nitric oxide: Carbon monoxide is a quite conservative (i.e. nonreactive) air pollutant. One pathway for breaking down CO is by oxidation by molecular oxygen in water and sunlight. Second-order reactions also occur in the stratosphere, including the reactions involving O(1D): These reactions are involved in what is known as a null cycle, i.e. the net result of the reactions is that no products are formed or degraded, but light energy is absorbed and molecules are heated. Second order reactions occur at extremely short wavelength ultraviolet radiation, such as: A pathway explains how reactive NO and O are formed from relatively nonreactive molecular nitrogen and oxygen via ultraviolet radiation: 5.6.2 Organic Reactions Reaction rate calculations for organic compounds are similar to those for inorganic reactions, but elementary reactions are not often applied to transformations of organic compounds in the atmosphere. 5.6.3 Hydrolysis Compounds are degraded when they react with water. Hydrolysis is the potential of the chemical to be transformed into a byproduct and water. Hydrolysis occurs in every environmental compartment and is a key part of metabolism by organisms. Molecules react with water vapor in the atmosphere. Hydrolysis is also important before and after the atmospheric residence of a pollutant. For example, complex molecules may be hydrolyzed by biotic and abiotic mechanisms, forming smaller, lighter molecules that have higher vapor pressures or that are more soluble in water. Following deposition, air pollutants may become hydrolyzed, making them more bioavailable and more likely to be taken up by organisms. Within organisms, hydrolysis is a key process in metabolism, making substances more polar (i.e. adding hydroxyl ions [OH]), and increasing the aqueous solubility; thus, the compounds are more easily eliminated. Hydrolysis often occurs simultaneously with other chemical transformation mechanisms. In thermal processes to break down large organic molecules, hydrolysis occurs along with gasification, pyrolysis, and combustion: \\[\\ce{C20H32O10 +x1O2 +x2H2O -&gt;[][\\Delta] y1C + y2CO2 +y3CO +y4H2 +y5CH4 +y6H2O +y7C_nH_m}\\] The coefficients x and y balance the compounds on either side of the reaction. The delta under the arrow indicates heating. Hydrolysis is highly dependent on temperature, with slight changes dramatically affecting the rate of the reaction e.g. some reaction rates will more than double with a 10 °F increase. 5.6.4 Multicompartmental Photochemical Transformation As mentioned, solar radiation influences the chemical processes in the atmosphere by interacting with molecules that act as photoacceptors. Free radicals are formed by the photodissociation of certain types of molecules. These free radicals are highly reactive neutral fragments of stable reactive molecules. Examples include atomic oxygen (O), atomic hydrogen (H), the hydroxyl radical (OH), and the hydroperoxy radical (HO2). Aldehydes are the principal photoacceptors in photochemical oxidant smog, NO2, nitrous acid (HNO2), and O3. Photodissociation depends on the energy provided by photons. Photochemical degradation occurs in all compartments where sunlight is present. A compound will often undergo several types of transformation, including abiotic, e.g. photolysis, and biotic degradation. Photons (hv) interact with and transform the molecules directly: \\[\\ce{A +hv -&gt; A +B}\\] Photons also form many highly reactive atmospheric free radicals, which are chemical species with an unpaired electron in the outermost shell. This unpaired electron imparts very high free energies to a radical, making it much more reactive than its nonradical counterparts. A chemical species with an odd number of electrons is a radical, whereas one with an even number of electrons is a nonradical. NO is a radical since N has seven electrons and O has eight, for a sum of 15 electrons. However, HNO3 is a nonradical since H has one electron, N has seven and three O atoms (3 *8) has 24 electrons, for a sum of 32 electrons. Given their reactivity, free radical concentrations are quite small in the atmosphere, usually &lt; 1ppb. These relatively small numbers are crucial to most atmospheric transformations, given that free radicals actually transform most chemical species in the atmosphere. Thus, free radical kinetics plays a large role in air pollution kinetics. Given a radical’s high free energy, they are generally formed endothermically from nonradical species, i.e. an external source of energy is needed. This energy is supplied by sunlight in the atmosphere: \\[\\ce{nonradical +hv -&gt; radical +radical}\\] Equation (17.53) provides the first step in the propagation of radical reaction chains, i.e. subsequent reactions of radicals with nonradical species: \\[\\ce{radical +nonradical -&gt; radical +nonradical}\\] To conserve the total odd number of electrons, the reaction of a radical with a nonradical must always yield a radical. The radical produced then reacts with another nonradical, and so on. A nonradical species produced in this manner may photolyze so that additional radicals are generated according to Eq. (17.54). Truncating the chain requires reactions between radicals; that is, a radical plus a radical that produces a nonradical and a nonradical. The termination may also involve a third body (M), which is any relatively nonreactive molecule (often N2 and O2) that removes excess energy, dissipating it as heat: \\[\\ce{radical +radical +M -&gt; nonradical +M}\\] Such termination reactions generally occur more slowly than propagation reactions because radicals are present at low concentrations and collisions between radicals are therefore relatively infrequent. 5.7 溫室效應與臭氧層破壞的問題 5.7.1 溫室效應發生原因 到達地球的太陽能中約有30%被反射，其餘皆被地球表面吸收而轉換成熱量，然後再以紅外線的型態將此熱量放射出去。 由於CO2具有吸收紅外線的特性，因此大氣中的CO2濃度增加後，本來要輻射到太空中的紅外線卻被CO2吸收而轉換成熱量，使地球氣溫上升。 5.7.2 導致大氣中CO2濃度增加的原因 因經濟成長、工業發展使化石燃料之使用大幅度增加。 熱帶雨林之破壞，森林面積減少。 人口增加及其附帶的畜牧業發達所導致之CO2排放量的增加，約可與能源節約或燃料轉換所降低之CO2排放量相抵消。 能源結構之轉變。 5.7.3 京都議定書 為解決溫室氣體所造成的氣候變化，重點包括: 減量期程與目標值: 工業國將人為排放之六種溫室氣體換算為二氧化碳總量，與1990年相較，平均削減值5.2%。減量期程為2008-2012年，並以此5年平均值為準。 六種溫室氣體中，CO2、CH4、N2O(氧化亞氮)管制基準年為1990年，而HFCs(氟氯碳化物)、PFCs(全氟碳化物)與六氟化硫SF6為1995年。 碳排放交易制度: 允許締約國彼此間進行排放交易。 森林吸收溫室氣體之功能予以考量: 1990年以後所進行之植林及森林採伐之二氧化碳吸收或排放之淨值，可包括於削減量之內。 聯合執行機制:容許工業國家為各自的減排目標合作。 成立清潔發展機制: 由工業國對開發中國家提供技術及財務協助，進行溫氣氣體減量計劃，所削減之數量由雙方共享。 5.7.4 哥本哈根會議 2009年於哥本哈根舉行，決定2012-2017年全球減排協議。會前提出幾項因溫室氣體所導致的氣候變遷問題指標: 海平面上升: IPCC(聯合國政府氣候變遷問題小組)指出，自1961-1990年期間，海平面上升速度為1.8mm/年，但自1991年以來，上升速度為3.1mm/年;預計到2100年，海平面將較目前上升18-59公分。 海洋酸化: 海洋吸收越多CO2，海水酸度就越高，影響珊瑚、微生物和貝類動物，會嚴重影響生態多樣性和漁業。 北極冰量: Greenland自2000年迄今已流失1.5兆噸的水，造成海平面上升0.75mm。 南極暖化:過去50年南極溫度上升2.5 °C，是全球的6倍。 冰河面積縮小。 冰凍層融化導致北西伯利亞多個湖泊沼氣排放量大幅度上升(沼氣主要成分為CH4，其全球暖化潛勢為CO2的23倍)。 四季轉移: 部份鳥類和魚類因氣溫上升而改變棲息地。 降雨量改變: 1900-2005年間，南北美洲東部、歐洲北部及中北亞的降雨/降雪量明顯增加;非洲南部和部份南亞的降雨/降雪量則減少。 哥本哈根會議最後決議 並未能確定各國的減排目標。 保持全球平均溫度較工業化時代的升幅不超過2 °C，長期目標設定為1.5 °C以內。 發達國家在2010-2012年間提供300億美元用於協助發展中國家應對氣候變化，如使用再生能源、保護森林、適應氣候災難等。 因應措施 削減CO2的排放量 將含碳量較高的化石燃料轉換成含碳量較低的石化燃料。 推廣使用乾淨能源，如太陽能、風力、海水溫差發電、核能發電等。 對於汽車、家電用品、照明設備設定能源消耗的標準，亦即提高能源使用效率 改善產業結構 – “二高、二低、二大”: 二高: 高附加價值，高科技。 二低: 低污染，低能源密集。 二大: 產業關聯效果大，市場發展潛力大。 節約能源，提高能源使用效率，減少能源生產過程及電力傳輸所發生之損耗。 發展低碳經濟及再生能源。 造林工作: 估計每公頃森林平均每年可吸收37公噸的二氧化碳，另可防止土壤侵蝕，減少土石流或季節性水患發生機率。 5.7.5 氟氯碳化物破壞臭氧層之機制 氟氯碳化物是非常安定的化學物質，不容易分解，一旦被釋放出來後，會上升至平流層中，而臭氧層主要即存在於平流層中。 上升至25公里左右的氟氯碳化物因紫外線(UV)的照射，行光分解反應，釋出具有破壞力的氯原子。 氯原子的反應性非常高，它先與臭氧反應生成氧化氯(ClO)，氧化氯再和氧原子反應，而放出破壞臭氧的氯原子。 \\[\\ce{O3 -&gt;[UV] O2 + O}\\] \\[\\ce{O2 + O -&gt;

NO2 +O2}\\] \\[\\ce{NO +O3 -&gt; NO2^{*} +O2}\\] \\[\\ce{NO2^{*} -&gt; hv +NO2}\\] NO2總量的5~10%是由第二個反應生成的，輻射能量hv之強度可由光電放大器(Photomultiplier)測得，輻射之強度與氣體樣品中最初之NO濃度成正比。若樣品中含NO及NO2，則在將氣體導入化學螢光反應室之前，先經一受熱的不鏽鋼，將NO2轉化成NO，反應如下 接著再與O3於反應室中反應，測得總NOx濃度(A)。另外再準備一個樣品，不經過不鏽鋼管而測得NO濃度(B)，A減B之值即為氣體樣品中NO2的量。 NO2總量的5~10%是由第二個反應生成的，輻射能量hv之強度可由光電放大器(Photomultiplier)測得，輻射之強度與氣體樣品中最初之NO濃度成正比。若樣品中含NO及NO2，則在將氣體導入化學螢光反應室之前，先經一受熱的不鏽鋼，將NO2轉化成NO，反應如下 接著再與O3於反應室中反應，測得總NOx濃度(A)。另外再準備一個樣品，不經過不鏽鋼管而測得NO濃度(B)，A減B之值即為氣體樣品中NO2的量。 5.8.3 CO濃度之測定 非分散性紅外線分析器(Nondispersive Infrared Analyzer) – 由於CO會吸收某特定波長的紅外線，故可利用此特性測定其濃度。 偵測器含有兩個槽室(Chamber)，將氣體樣品打入其中一室，另兩室則充滿惰性氣體(如N2)。此時分別以紅外線照射此兩室，因為CO會吸收部分能量，故通過參考槽的紅外線能量較高；通過兩槽室的紅外線再由兩個都填充CO的偵測器接收，圖(Next slide)左邊偵測器中之CO受熱較多故膨脹較大，因而推動兩偵測器間之隔膜，隔膜移動程度可轉換成電訊傳出再紀錄於記錄器上，因此可連續測定樣品種CO的濃度。 5.8.4 碳氫化合物之測定 火焰式離子化法(Flame Ionization) – 於火焰離子檢測器(FID)內，氣體樣品注入於空氣或氧氣中燃燒的氫氣火焰中，如圖所示。火焰位於電極之間，兩電極間有幾百伏特之電位差，當氫氣單獨燃燒時，只形成少數的離子，但若碳氫化合物之樣品氣體注入氫氣時，火焰中即形成離子並游離至正極，所產生的直流電訊號(DC signal)與形成的離子數成正比，形成的離子數又與火焰中之碳原子數成正比。 FID只能測得碳氫化合物之總量，但不能區分碳氫化合物之各種不同成分，若欲檢測碳氫化合物成分時，可使用氣體層析儀 (Gas Chromotography, GC) "],["w05_0322.html", "Chapter 6 W05_0322", " Chapter 6 W05_0322 能源 所謂净零碳排 科技業 臺積電 買碳權 中小企業的生存空間？ 核電， 要學習怎麽問問題 重點是要怎麽問問題 空氣污染，因爲設備因素，通常只關心pm2.5 微粒，應該更關注pm1更好 沉降速度 去除效率 聽不懂 T^T "],["w09_0419.html", "Chapter 7 W09_0419 7.1 air pollution control 7.2 control 有限制（engenieering 可施作的範圍） 7.3 feul switch 7.4 整個程序關停！", " Chapter 7 W09_0419 pm2.5 24hr avg 15 mg (來自某一期間，對於環境流行病學的研究，WHO的建議是：10) 空氣品質科學、空氣品質工程 critical thinking 7.1 air pollution control Difinition c.f. \\(\\require{mhchem}\\) \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) pollution 對人體健康 超過環境的含容力 contamination 毒性、致癌性、可突變性 soil-contamination 重金屬 PCB 環境荷爾蒙至性狀突變 7.2 control 有限制（engenieering 可施作的範圍） 針對source natural （volcanos要控制，有難度） anthvogogenic （coal combustion） 清净燃料也會產生污染物 流程 control device 只是其中一項，末端管理，end-of-pipe control device source control（pollution prevention） 永遠優於 末端治理 能源利用效率的提升也是污染預防的一種手段 燃燒器的有效運作 工程師的工作是 mass 和 energy 的 balance 烟囪！高烟囪效力 烟囪本身就是一種控制設備 環境法規，高度標準 擴散！ 環境大自然的自我療愈，自我療傷，環境含容能力 降低濃度 烟囪不可能無止儘地上升 經濟考慮 推力、熱 違反環境正義 7.3 feul switch nature gas會有什麽嚴重的問題 清净能源的限制、隱憂、長期造成的環境衝擊 綠能如果不是真正的綠能，對於環境的衝擊可能要到幾十年之後才看得到。 7.4 整個程序關停！ 要評估正面負面影響。 "],["w10_0426席老師.html", "Chapter 8 W10_0426（席老師） 8.1 控制策略 8.2 Incineration 燃燒、焚化（c.f.樂色焚化（固體廢棄物，都市樂色是有熱質的，輔以一定程度的輔助燃料）） 8.3 Condensation(seperation process)", " Chapter 8 W10_0426（席老師） 工程師，主要考慮管末控制技術 污染物之類型： 粒狀 氣狀 gaseous air pollutant 以氣體的方式存在 organic 環保法有嚴格的定義 VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds 揮發性有機化合物) pah（環狀的Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons多環芳香烴） non-organic CO2 SO2 NO/NO2/N2O metals (Hg) 針對不同類型的污染物，其控制技術差異甚大 擬定、制定污染控制策略，要完整考慮： 種類 量 氣體的量【體積：1000m3】 污染物的量【濃度：10ppm/1000ppm】 質 之後還要考慮設置成本 8.1 控制策略 控制策略 Catalytic oxidation Incineration 燃燒 Condensation 冷凝 Absorption 吸收 Adsorption 吸附 Biofiltration 生物過濾 photocatalysis 光催化 8.2 Incineration 燃燒、焚化（c.f.樂色焚化（固體廢棄物，都市樂色是有熱質的，輔以一定程度的輔助燃料）） 去除效率的目標，一定大於95，要到99% 一般是用來處理低濃度、高毒性的有機氣體 the process of burning something completely 目的是物質的最終氧化態，destruction 不一定要氧作爲助燃劑。 主要針對有機物 需要混合足夠均匀、足夠的溫度、足夠的停留時間… 3 conditions (3Ts): time, temperature, turbulence 燃燒的效果才會夠好 要有燃料，最好產生的熱是可以被回收的 要讓燃燒發生，需要污染物的濃度要： 達到下限值 低於上限值 燃燒時往往要添加助燃劑 原污染氣體空氣量不足時，要補入空氣 燃料，一定是容易取得，好操作的 天然氣 石油（柴油 足夠的停留時間，才能然污染物被完全地破壞 爲了停留時間變長，燃燒器的長度要增加，體積要增大，更占地方，也需要更多燃料 所以燃燒器的大小要適中， 工程設計是考量各個面嚮，權重，權衡之後得到的結果。 一般不會停留超過2秒，不然燃燒器要很大 8.2.1 Ignition 5個重點： 8.2.2 燃燒器設計 case1: 半導體，溶劑：A5H3溶度極低但毒性極高。 case2: 減少氮氧化物的生成 8.2.3 專有名詞 \\(\\require{mhchem}\\) \\(\\ce{1CH4 + 2O2=1 CO2 +2H2O}\\) fuel rich 富燃，燃燒的燃料超過能夠捕入的，&gt;

The element exists in myriad chemical forms that move at varying rates in the nitrogen cycle. Like carbon discussed in the previous chapter, N is stored in reservoirs such as the atmosphere, living organisms, soils, and oceans. From these sinks, N cycles between the biosphere and the atmosphere. The N cycles among ecosystems and the organisms, including humans, within these ecosystems. Most of the earth’s mass of N resides in the atmosphere. Approximately 79% of the molecules in Earth’s atmosphere are molecular nitrogen (N2). All organisms must metabolize N into larger molecules; notably amino acids, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Amino acids contain the functional group amine (NH2) and are the building blocks of proteins. DNA consists of adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, which consist of rings of carbon and nitrogen atoms, with various side chains. The N2 is not directly available to most organisms (a major exception being the N-fixing bacteria found in legume roots). The atmospheric N2 is converted to bioavailable N species (e.g. nitrates; NO3 ) abiotically (e.g. lightning strikes or fires) and biotically (e.g. by the N-fixing bacteria known as diazotrophs). Decomposers convert N in the opposite direction, i.e. mineralization, converting the N-containing organic molecules of dead organisms to inorganic compounds, e.g. ammonium (NH4+) salts. The (NH4+) salts have high aqueous solubility and readily absorbed to soil particles. At these sites, bacteria and other microbes can oxidize the NH4+ into nitrite (NO2- ) compounds and in turn to nitrate (NO3- ) compounds. This oxidation process is known as nitrification. These dissolved oxidized forms of N are reduced (i.e. denitrified) by bacteria known as denitrifiers. This is a major process by which N is returned to the atmosphere. Ionization is an important part of N and S cycling, as it is for all nutrient cycling. This is due to the configuration of electrons in an atom. The arrangement of the electrons in the atom’s outermost shell, i.e. valence, determines the ultimate chemical behavior of the atom. The outer electrons become involved in the transfer and the sharing the shells with other atoms, i.e. forming new compounds and ions. An atom will gain or lose valence electrons to form a stable ion that has the same number of electrons as the noble gas nearest the atom’s atomic number. As mentioned, the N cycle includes three principal forms that are soluble in water under environmental conditions: the cation (positively charged ion) ammonium (NH4+) and the anions (negatively charged ions) nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-). Nitrates and nitrites combine with various organic and inorganic compounds. Following entry into the body, NO3- is converted to NO2- . Since NO3- is soluble and readily available as a nitrogen source for plants (e.g. to form plant tissue such as amino acids and proteins), farmers are the biggest users of NO3- compounds in commercial fertilizers (although even manure can contain high levels of NO3 ). Nitrogen in several forms finds its way from the atmosphere to the soil through abiotic and biotic processes. NO3- compounds are formed from lightning and by nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legumes’ root nodules. The Rhizobia (genera Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium) are Gram-negative motile, rod-shaped, aerobic soil bacteria that infect legume roots in a symbiotic relationship with legumes, e.g. Medicago, Melilotus, and Trigonella. The symbiotic relationship results from the bacteria fixing atmospheric nitrogen, providing ammonium for protein production in the plant. In exchange, the bacteria obtain energy from the plant. Nitrate compounds are also formed by microbial (fungal and bacterial) degradation of detritus by aerobes and anaerobes on the forest floor. With moisture, numerous simultaneous chemical reactions occur, making for a balance among various chemical forms of N (as well as those of S, P, K, C, and other nutrients). The chemical reactions in the N cycle, as in any nutrient cycle, require various energy sources, especially light, heat, and metabolic energy. Some biochemical processes within an organism fix molecular nitrogen (N2) from the atmosphere to form simple N-compounds (e.g. diazotrophs in root nodules), which in turn form amino acids in the tissues of plants and animals. The mineralization and denitrification occurs by numerous processes, in addition to microbial degradation, including photolysis, hydrolysis, and reduction or oxidation. The result is a wide array of conversions of nitrogen-containing organic compounds (e.g. proteins and amino acids) to inorganic (mineral) forms, such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, nitrite, and nitrate. Note that the gases at the top of Figure in next slide include those that are important in air pollution. 氮元素的循環（1） 氮元素的循環（2） For example, NO is one of the compounds involved in the photochemistry that leads to the formation of the pollutant ozone (O3) in the troposphere. Note also that the relationship between microbes and macrophytes is central in the figure. Much of the chemistry occurs on the floor in the detritus where microbes degrade complex molecules. Nutrients in the soil are transported by the roots capillary action to plant cells. Gases are transpired through leaves back to the atmosphere. The atmospheric speciation at the top of the Figure is an oversimplification, with many competing processes. For example, NO2 compounds in the soil can release nitrous acid (HONO) directly to the atmosphere. When soil contains elevated amounts of nitrates due to fertilization, HONO is released to the atmosphere. The more acidic the soil, the greater will be the release of HONO. In the troposphere, HONO leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which both degrade and increase the deposition of air pollutants. Large volumes of acids are released from soil continuously to the atmosphere. Soils with high N concentrations form the acids from NO2 ions. These anions are first released into the soil by microbes that have transformed ammonium and nitrate ions into nitrite ions. Increasing soil acidity produces high nitrite concentrations, leading to greater concentrations of HONO emitted to the troposphere. About 30% of the primary OH radical production is attributed to the photolysis of HONO. The Figure also shows that when organic compounds are degraded by microbes, especially nitrifying bacteria, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are released to the atmosphere. The flux of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the soil to the lower troposphere is inversely related to the rate of degradation of organic compounds in the soil. Ion exchange is actually an example of sorption; i.e., movement of a chemical species from the liquid or gas phase to the solid phase. Plants grow as a function of available nutrients that they are able to sorb, which is affected by available N and other cycles within the forest ecosystem. With this growth, compounds of N and other nutrients find their way to the atmosphere. Nitrogen has three common oxidation states, +3, +4, and +5. Thus, like carbon, the multiple oxidation states mean that N can form many compounds, even with a single, other element. For example, it can combine with oxygen to form N2O, NO, NO2, or N2O5, all important air pollutants or precursors to air pollutants. Nitrite is an intermediate compound in both nitrification and denitrification. The N in the nitrate anion (NO3- ) has an oxidation state of +5 (i.e. three O atoms each with 2 charge plus 5 yields the nitrate charge of 1). The nitrite anion has a trivalent N, i.e. N3+ (i.e. two O atoms each with 2 charge plus 3 yields the nitrite charge of 1). The major mechanism for producing N3+ in soil is by biological nitrification and denitrification processes. Nitrifying microbes produce nitrite ions from ammonium. Denitrifying microbes produce nitrite from nitrate. In addition to the ordinary concentrations of molecular N, various nitrogen compounds are formed from reactions ranging from very fast (especially combustion) to quite slow, multistage (microbial) reaction rates. The two principal air pollutants regulated throughout the world are nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide. \\(\\require{mhchem}\\) Nitric oxide (NO) is a colorless, odorless gas and is essentially insoluble in water. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has a pungent acid odor and is somewhat soluble in water. Air pollution experts now refer to NO and NO2 collectively as NOx. This is in part because the NO lifetime after emission is quite short (&gt;minute &lt;hour). The simple oxidation of molecular N at high temperature is \\(\\ce{N2 + O2 -&gt;[\\Delta] 2NO}\\) (22.1) The emitted NO rapidly undergoes photochemical transformation to NO2: \\(\\ce{2NO + O2 -&gt; 2NO2}\\) (22.2) Indeed, NO and NO2 can interconvert, depending on redox and photochemical conditions in the troposphere and stratosphere. For example, in sunlight, ultraviolet radiation splits NO2 into NO and O. So, it is often preferred to consider the dynamic relationship of the two molecules rather than to ascribe a single speciation, especially for characterizing the atmosphere. However, the two compounds must be distinguished in risk assessments given their very different health effects. Mobile sources (i.e. cars, trucks, trains, boats, and aircraft) comprise the largest contributor to NOx emissions in the Untied States (59%; 12.7 Mt in 2002). The US’s largest contributing stationary source category is electric generation (22%; 4.6 Mt in 2002), followed by industrial factories (11%; 2.4 Mt in 2002). Europe has similar emission profiles for NOx, with the largest percentage coming from mobile sources (road and nonroad transport), and the largest stationary source being energy production and distribution. Although both NO and NO2 can be harmful to humans and ecosystems, NO is also actually essential to metabolism, so is harmful at much higher concentrations than that of NO2. On the other hand, NO2 is inherently toxic, causing respiratory problems. Both compounds are precursors to tropospheric ozone formation, so present indirect health problems when the smog and O3 are inhaled. Nitrogen species important to air quality include many compounds in addition to NOx. Atmospheric N reactions can be more complicated than may be inferred from Reactions (22.1) and (22.2). For example, the NOx reaction from NO to NO2 likely involves water and an intermediate, i.e. nitrous acid (HONO): \\(\\ce{4NO +O2 +2H2O -&gt; 4HONO}\\) The larger suite of N air pollution compounds is known as total reactive nitrogen, which is denoted as NOy. This suite includes NO and NO2, plus their oxidation products. The major vapor phase and particulate constituents of NOy include NO, NO2, nitric acid (HNO3), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), HONO, organic nitrates, and particulate nitrates: \\(\\ce{NO_{y}= NO2 + NO +HNO_3 +PAN} \\\\\\ce{ + 2NO2O5 + HONO + NO3} \\\\\\ce{+ NO3- compounds + NO3- aerosols}\\) Every NOy compound is derived directly from NOx emissions or through transformations in the troposphere Most of the compounds originate from combustion processes. The atmosphere itself is the source of much of the nitrogen leading to the formation of nitrogen compounds. Molecular nitrogen (N2) makes up the largest share of gaseous content of the earth’s atmosphere (79% by volume). Because N2 is relatively nonreactive under most atmospheric conditions, it seldom enters into chemical reactions, but under pressure and at very high temperatures, such as in an internal combustion engine or industrial boiler, the molecular N will react with O2, i.e. Reaction (22.1). Approximately 90 - 95% of the nitrogen oxides generated in combustion processes are in the form of NO. Other nitrogen oxides can also form at high heat and pressure, especially NO2. Most motor vehicles around the world still employ temperature/high-pressure internal combustion engines. Such mobile sources contribute largely to the tropospheric concentrations of NOx, making it a major mobile source of air pollutant in terms of human health directly (e.g. respiratory toxicity of NO2) and indirectly (i.e. NOx as the key components in tropospheric ozone production). These conditions of high temperature and pressure can also exist in boilers such as those in power plants, so NOx is also commonly found in high concentrations leaving fossil fuel power generating stations. In addition to the atmospheric molecular nitrogen as a precursor of nitrogen air pollutants of combustion, fossil fuels themselves contain varying concentrations of N. Unlike the sulfur compounds, which mainly exit stationary source stacks as vapor phase compounds (e.g. SO2 and other oxides of sulfur), a significant fraction of the fuel nitrogen burned in power plants and other stationary sources remains in the bottom ash or in unburned aerosols in the gases leaving the combustion chamber, i.e. the fly ash. Nitrogen oxides can also be released from nitric acid plants and other types of industrial processes involving the generation and/or use of nitric acid (HNO3). At temperatures far below combustion, such as those often present in the ambient atmosphere, NO2 can form the molecule NO2-O2N or simply N2O4 that consists of two identical simpler NO2 molecules. This molecular configuration is known as a dimer. The dimer N2O4 is distinctly reddish brown and contributes to the brown haze that is often associated with photochemical smog incidents. In addition to the health effects associated with NO2 exposure, much of the concern for regulating emissions of nitrogen compounds is to suppress the reactions in the atmosphere that generate the highly reactive molecule ozone (O3). Nitrogen oxides play key roles in O3 formation. Ozone forms photochemically (i.e. the reaction is caused or accelerated by light energy) in the lowest level of the atmosphere, known as the troposphere, where people and other biota live. Nitrogen dioxide is the principal gas responsible for absorbing sunlight needed for these photochemical reactions. In the presence of sunlight, the NO2 that forms from the NO incrementally stimulates the photochemical smog-forming reactions because nitrogen dioxide is very efficient at absorbing sunlight in the ultraviolet portion of its spectrum. This is why ozone episodes are more common in the summer and in areas with ample sunlight. Other chemical ingredients, i.e. ozone precursors, in O3 formation include volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide (CO). Governments regulate the emissions of precursor compounds to diminish the rate at which O3 forms. Cyanide (CN) is another N anion that is important to air pollution. Cyanide in the bloodstream impairs oxidative phosphorylation, a process by which oxygen is taken up for the production of essential cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process transfers electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to form water from H+ and O2, through a series of reactions catalyzed by enzymes. With less O2 available to react with the cytochrome C and hence complete the electron transport process, ATP production is diminished. The high binding affinity of CN to the ferric ion in hemoglobin is responsible for the decrease in O2 carried in the blood. Thus, CN binds preferentially to hemoglobin and prohibits oxygen binding PM2.5 和 臭氧，晚上會生成SOA（次級有機氣膠）；NOx 參與形成SIA,即無機氣膠 Methemoglobinemia is a particularly troublesome outcome resulting from endogenous production of the CN anion, such as from the exposure of infants to nitrates in drinking water. Ingesting high concentrations of nitrates can cause serious short-term illness and even death in infants of 6 months or younger. The serious illness in infants is due to the conversion of microbial NO3- to NO2- in the gastrointestinal tract. NO3- is more easily converted to NO2- than in adult hemoglobin and circulatory system, which are too immature in small children to return to normal hemoglobin. As a result, the increased NO2- concentrations interfere with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. 10.2 The Nitrogen and Sulfur Cycles– Interactions between Sulfur and Nitrogen From the standpoint of air pollution, the biogeochemical cycles must not be limited to single elements. As shown in Figure 22.6, after a compound is emitted, it reacts with numerous other compounds and changes physically and chemically. It is transported advectively, is dispersed, and finally deposited to the earth’s surface, where it continues to undergo physical, chemical, and biological changes. This is demonstrated by the interactions of N and S in acid deposition, as well as by the integration of myriad atmospheric chemical species that influence and are influenced by N and S. This includes both the formation of conventional NAAQS pollutants, like ozone and particulate matter (PM), as well as the transformation and changes in bioavailability of toxic air pollutants, e.g. mercury (Hg) and semivolatile organic compounds like dioxins and organochlorine pesticides. The atmospheric movement of N and S compounds and other pollutants from sources to receptors is only one form of translocation. The second one involves the attempt to control air pollutants at the source. For example, the control of SO2 and PM by wet or dry scrubbing techniques yields large quantities of waste materials often toxic which are subsequently stored onsite at the facility or taken to landfills and other long-term disposal sites. If these wastes are not properly stored, they can be released to soil or water systems, e.g. from runoff of acids or spills into nearby surface water, resulting in acidic, as well as heavy metal and metalloid contamination. The prime examples involve the disposal of toxic materials in dump sites or landfills. However, given the massive volume of wastes generated by energy production, especially ash from coal-fired power plants, such solid waste laws are limited in their ability to ensure proper storage in ash piles and pits, putting adjacent surface water and groundwater at risk. The oxidized chemical species of sulfur and nitrogen, e.g. sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), form acids when they react with water. This can occur in any media, e.g. the atmosphere (i.e. acid deposition), and in mining waste and ash runoff to surface waters and groundwater. The lowered pH is responsible for numerous environmental problems. Many compounds contain both N and S along with the typical organic elements (C, H, and O). The reaction for the combustion of such compounds, in general form, is Reaction (22.5) demonstrates the incremental complexity as additional elements enter the reaction. In the real world, pure reactions are rare. The environment is filled with mixtures and heterogeneous reactions. Reactions can occur in sequence, parallel, or both. Combustion specifically and oxidation generally are very important processes that lead to N and S pollutants. But they are certainly not the only ones. Oxidation and reduction of N and S occur in ecosystems as represented by trophic state and energy levels. The formation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitric oxide (NO) by acidifying molecular sulfur is a redox reaction: The designations in parentheses give the physical phase of each reactant and product: “s” for solid; “aq” for aqueous; and “g” for gas. The oxidation half-reactions for this reaction are the following: 22.7 The reduction half-reactions for this reaction are as follows: \\(\\ce{NO3- -&gt; NO}\\) \\(\\ce{NO3- + 4H+ +3e^- -&gt; NO + 2H2O}\\) Therefore, the balanced oxidation-reduction reactions are 22.11 10.3 The Nitrogen and Sulfur Cycles– The Sulfur Cycle Compounds of sulfur (S), as those of N, exist at atmospheric concentrations well in excess of what would be expected from equilibrium geochemistry in an atmosphere with 21% O2. Sulfur is released to the atmosphere as either reduced forms, e.g. hydrogen sulfide, or oxidized forms, e.g. sulfur dioxide (Figure next slide). Both forms include air pollutants. Hydrogen sulfide is oxidized to sulfur dioxide in a three-step process. Note that the hydroxyl radical initiates the transformation from hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide: The atmospheric reactions of SO2 are very complex, and proceed through at least three different pathways to the sulfate ion (SO4 2-). Sulfur dioxide can react with the hydroxyl radical to form the HSO3 radical, which then can react with another hydroxyl radical to form water and SO3 or H2SO4. Sulfur dioxide has sufficient aqueous solubility to dissolve in water droplets where it can react with oxygen gas to form SO4 2-. The third pathway to sulfate occurs when sulfur dioxide reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form sulfuric acid: With sufficient residence time in the atmosphere, S will be oxidized to the sulfate ion, usually forming sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Ammonia (NH3), the most common base in the atmosphere, reacts with H2SO4 to form ammonium bisulfate (NH4HSO4) and ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4). The compounds H2SO4, NH4HSO4, and (NH4)2SO4 all are hydroscopic substances, i.e. readily dissolved in water. Thus, they wash out of the atmosphere during precipitation events. Arguably, the most common reduced form of sulfur that is the highly toxic and important pollutant, hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Certain microbes, especially bacteria, reduce nitrogen and sulfur, using the N or S as energy sources through the acceptance of electrons. For example, sulfur-reducing bacteria can produce H2S by chemically changing oxidized forms of sulfur, especially sulfates (compounds containing the ion, SO4 2-). To do so, the bacteria must have access to the sulfur, i.e. it must be in the water, which can be in surface or groundwater, or the water in soil and sediment. These sulfur reducers are often anaerobes, i.e. bacteria that live in water where concentrations of molecular oxygen (O2) are deficient. The bacteria remove the O2 molecule from the sulfate leaving only the S, which in turn combines with hydrogen (H) to form gaseous H2S. In groundwater, sediment water, and soil water, H2S is formed from the anaerobic or nearly anaerobic decomposition of deposits of organic matter, e.g. plant residues. Thus, redox principles can be used to treat H2S contamination, i.e. the compound can be oxidized using a number of different oxidants Strong oxidizers, like molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, most effectively oxidize the reduced forms of S, N, or any reduced compound. Sulfur is also an important component of PM. For example, diesel PM is formed by a number of simultaneous physical processes during cooling and dilution of exhaust, i.e. nucleation, coagulation, condensation, and adsorption. The core of the particles is formed by nucleation and coagulation from primary spherical particles consisting of solid carbonaceous matter, known as elemental carbon (EC) and ash (metals and other elements). By coagulation, adsorption, and condensation, various organic and S compounds (e.g. sulfates) are added and combined with other condensed material (Figure 22.8) 22.8 The small diameter of diesel PM (&lt; 0.5 µm) makes for very large surface areas. Less than 0.5 µm, these particles have a very large surface area per gram of mass, which allows them to adsorb large quantities of ash, organic compounds, and sulfate. The specific surface area of the EC core is approximately 30-50 m2 g-1 . The organic constituents originate from unburned fuel, engine lubrication oil, and small quantities of partial combustion and pyrolysis products. During combustion, S compounds in the fuel are oxidized to sulfur dioxide (SO2). From 1% to 4% of fuel S is oxidized to form H2SO4. Upon cooling, this sulfuric acid and water condense into an aerosol that is non-volatile under ambient conditions. 10.4 氮氧化物(NOx)的控制 氮氧化物P - NOx – NO及NO2之總稱，其中95%為NO。 NOx之影響 - 直接危害人體健康 - 妨害植物生長 - 生成光化學氧化物，通常為煙霧(Smog)。NOx在陽光照射下會與碳氫化合物作用生成以O3為主的氧化物，臭氧會對呼吸器官早成嚴重傷害。 - 造成酸雨，NOx在大氣經過一連串的複雜反應，最後可轉化為硝酸。 台灣96年國家標準NOx排放濃度上限 - 氣體燃料: 150ppm - 液體燃料: 250ppm - 固體燃料: 350ppm NOx成因及防治原理 NOx成因 在燃燒過程中所產生的NOx主要有下述四種: 熱氮氧化物(Thermal NOx): 空氣中N2受熱氧化而形成的NOx。 燃料氮氧化物(Fuel NOx): 燃料中有機氮化物轉化而形成的NOx。 激態氮氧化物(Prompt NOx): 燃料經系列反應生成碳氫自由基，再與N2反應之後會與O2反 生成NOx物質，以甲烷為例說明如下: 燃料與NOx之產生 以天然氣及輕質油料為燃料時，NOx主要來自熱氮氧化物。 以重油為燃料時，燃料氮氧化物約佔總NOx量的50%。 以煤為燃料時，燃料氮氧化物約佔總NOx量的80%。 以不同燃料燃燒所生成之NOx種類及其所佔百分比如圖6.1。 熱氮氧化物的成因及防治 反應式 : 在高溫狀態下，且有過剩O2時產生，可能之反應機制如下: 影響因素 :實驗數據顯示，NO之濃度受溫度之影響最大，而且受N2、O2濃度及反應時間影響，關係如下： 防治方法：因此要降低熱氮氧化物可採下列方式： （１）降低N2含量：因空氣中N2之體積比達0.79，控制不易，故不擬控制。 （２）降低O2含量：可以低過剩空氣法（Low Excess Air, LEA）、分段燃燒法達到此一目的。 （３）降低最高燃燒溫度：可利用煙氣循環法及低空氣預熱法。 （４）減少在高溫之停留時間：煙氣循環法。 燃料氮氧化物的成因及防制 反應式：燃料中的含氮化合物通常是以Carbazole、Pyridine(C5H5N) and quinoline等形態存在。在燃燒時，這些物質會分解或氧化為CN, NH, NH2等分子，然後再進一步氧化為NO。 影響因素: 除了上述反應之外，還有一些反應會阻止或減少NO的生成，例如: 在氧氣不足的情況下，特別有利於上述反應之進行。另外，與熱氮氧化物相反的是燃料氮氧化物對燃燒區溫度不敏感，尤其是用煤做燃料時。但是燃料/空氣的混合狀況對燃料氮氧化物的影響很大，通常混合越好，NOx越多。 防制方法: 基本上要減少Fuel NOx最好的方法是將低過剩空氣法、分段燃燒法及改良式燃燒法一併使用。 NOx防制方法 可分為下列四種: 燃燒前處理: 燃料低氧化處理。 操作方式之改良 燃燒設備改良 燃燒後廢氣處理 燃料低氧化處理 針對液態燃料，如目前使用之重油及未來可能之煤液化燃料及油頁岩，發展加氫脫氮(Hydrodenitrogenaion)製程，開發新的HDN觸媒。 煤炭無法加氫脫氮處理，故盡量採用低氮煤炭。 操作方法之改良(Operational Modification) 歸納起來有下列幾種方法: 低過剩空氣(Low Excess Air, LEA)、低預熱空氣溫度(Reduced Air Preheat, RAP)、偏異燃燒控制(Fuel Biasing)及燃燒器空氣分配(Burners Out of Service, BOOS)。 低過剩空氣(LEA) 燃料若能完全燃燒而沒有過剩空氣，就不會有NOx生成，為目前較常用之控制技術，其效果端視燃料種類而定。 對燃料氣/燃料油其NOx主要來自Thermal NOx，可減少約25%，但對重油及煤炭，因其NOx主要來自Fule NOx，故效果有限，只能減少約5%。 低預熱空氣溫度(RAP) 工廠之加熱爐為了節約能源，通常設有空氣預熱器來加熱一次空氣(Primary Air)，結果使得火焰溫度升高而促進NOx之生成。降低空氣預熱程度可以降低火焰溫度而減少NOx，但也會降低能源效率。本法主要是降低Thermal NOx，因此對使用燃料氣及輕質燃油之場合較為有效。 偏異燃燒控制(Fuel Biasing)及燃燒器空氣分配(BOSS)(均是分段燃燒法的一種) (1)偏異燃燒控制: 在燃料過量之第一次燃燒後再加入補充空氣使剩餘燃料完全燃燒。本法須有較精密的操作技巧，NOx約可降低7%。 (2)燃燒器空氣分配: 將位於較外圍或較高位置的燃燒器之燃料切斷而只供應空氣之操作方式，如圖6.3，此法通常適用於操作量較大的加熱爐，NOx約可降低35%。 (3)以這兩種方法操作有下列好處: (a)可降低燃燒室的最高燃燒溫度。(b) 減少燃燒區之O2濃度。 可說是一種對降低Thermal NOx及Fuel NOx雙管齊下的方法。低過剩空氣配合分段燃燒法為降低NOx排放濃度相當有效的方法，一般可降低約40%的NOx。 燃燒設備改良 主要有下列幾種方法: 煙道氣再循環(Flue Gas Recirculation, FGR)、高位置空氣供應(Over Fire Air, OFA)、水或蒸汽注入(Water or Stream injection)、低NOx燃燒器(Low Nox Burner, LN)及廢氣再燃燒(Reburning)，以下加以介紹。 煙道氣再循環(FGR) 將燃燒後的廢氣再導入加熱爐燃燒，可降低火焰溫度並降低廢氣中含氧量，由於過剩氧氣減少，燃燒時即能有效抑制空氣氮氧化反應(Thermal NOx)。但是對於燃料氮氧化反應(Fuel NOx)之抑制較無效果。此法需將廢氣直接導入爐內的火焰，而不是只進入爐內循環而已，所以需修改加熱爐的部分結構，並增設可耐高溫的鼓風設備，故設備及操作費用較為昂貴。如果有空氣預熱裝置，則除了原有強制送風扇外，亦須增設一台煙道氣循環風扇。一般而言，循環回去爐內的廢氣量越多，NOx的減量效果越好，但是驅動鼓風機需消耗較多的能源。循環風扇可設置在空氣預熱器進口或出口。再循環廢氣量的多寡，影響了NOx的降低量，對於較輕質的燃料(例如柴油)，如果控制廢氣循環量在25%，可降低NOx約60%。 高位置空氣供應(OFA) 此法屬於階段式燃燒(Staged Combustion)的改良方法，亦即先使燃料在空氣不足的狀態下燃燒，然後在燃燒器上方或側方再注入空氣使其完全燃燒。由於在一次燃燒時，火焰溫度降低，故可減少NOx的生成。此法通常配合低過剩空氣(LEA)技術，可得到更好的效果。 基本上，階段式燃燒所利用的觀念為 燃料中的氮 水或蒸汽注入 注入水或蒸汽可降低燃燒火焰溫度，故可減少NOx生成。但此法較消耗能源，通常用於氣渦輪機(Gas Turbine)，原因是注入的水及蒸汽最後仍成為廢氣的一部分，可用以推動氣渦輪機的葉輪(Impeller)產生動力，可抵消耗費能源的不利因素。 低NOx燃燒器(LNB) (1)設計觀念 – 利用特殊設計之燃燒器來達到降低NOx之目的。主要是利用階段式燃燒的原理來設計燃燒器以達到降低燃燒溫度以及調整空氣供應方式以抑制NOx之生成，其設計之理念如圖6.6。 LNB設計上有階段式供應空氣(Staged-Air Burner)及階段式供應燃料(Staged-Fuel Burner)兩種。 (2)階段式供應空氣燃燒器(圖6.7) 燃燒所需空氣分兩段供給，第一次供給空氣量為所需空氣量之20至70%，由於氧氣不足及燃燒溫度降低，故可抑制NOx的生成，剩下的空氣則由二次空氣進氣孔注入，使未完全燃燒氣體在稀薄燃料狀態下進行，一方面使燃燒完全且燃燒溫度亦可不至太高，使得NOx之生成可有效予以控制。 (3) 階段式供應燃料燃燒器(圖6.8) LNB因火焰較長，通常只能用在爐內較深知加熱爐或鍋爐。 廢氣再燃燒(Reburning) 將廢氣再與燃料及空氣接觸，進一步燃燒，可以降低NOx約50%。使燃料及空氣與廢氣在燃嘴火焰外接觸，該區稱為後燃燒區(並非加入火焰直接燃燒)。這是與廢氣再循環(FGR)不同之處。本法是使燃料及空氣先在主燃燒區完全燃燒，所產生的NOx隨著廢氣與燃料及空氣在後燃燒區接觸後部分再還原成氮氣。主燃燒區的溫度約在900~1000 °C，而後燃燒區的溫度可達到1300~1540 °C，還原反應在此發生。由於本方法效果並不顯著，以及天然氣或柴油為燃料的加熱爐由於其NOx產生並不多，故通常不使用此方法。基本上，重質燃料燃燒產生的NOx較多，使用本法可以在較小的投資額下，達到明顯的效果。 燃燒改良對加熱爐操作性能之影響為: (1) 一氧化碳濃度增加 (2)微粒排放量增加 (3) 可能會有未燃燒完全之炭粒排出 (4) 爐膛熱吸收分布狀況之改變 (5) 能源效率之降低 燃燒後廢氣之處理 燃燒後產生的廢氣可以用化學反應的方法，將NOx轉化成無汙染的氮氣。由於控制燃燒技術僅能減少 一部分的NOx，要達到大幅度減量，則須借助脫硝反應的處理。常用的廢氣脫硝處理技術有: 選擇性無觸媒脫硝反應技術(Selective Noncatalytic Reduction, SNCR)，主要有NOx OUT及Thermal De NOx兩種方式。 選擇性觸媒脫硝反應技術(Selective Catalytic Reduction, SCR)。 選擇性無觸媒脫硝反應技術 1. NOx OUT 為Nalco Fuel Tech.推出之脫硝方法，其主要反應如下 反應只在相當狹窄的溫度範圍內進行，當反應溫度低於此溫度範圍時，會形成NH3，若反應溫度高於此溫度範圍時，NOx的還原率會降低。 2. Thermal De NOx (1)反應式 – 為Exxon Research and Engineering company推出之脫硝方法，其主要反應如下: 正常的反應溫度範圍在1600 °F~2200 °F之間，當溫度降低至1300 °F時，為維持有效的脫硝反應，在注入NH3時需伴隨注入H2，而當煙道器高溫時(T&gt;2200 °F)，注入的NH3反而使NOx增加。 (2) 注意事項 – 在正常反應過程中，會有少許NH3沒有參與反應而造成NH3的溢出(Slipage)，在低溫下，過剩溢出的NH3會與硫或氯成分反應而形成複雜的鹽類，其反應如下: (a) 當煙道氣溫度降至600 °F以下時，NH3會與SO3及蒸汽反應生成(NH4)HSO4及(NH4)2SO4，在商業化加熱爐的實際測試結果，只要定期水洗即可去除硫化物的沉澱物，加熱爐的空氣預熱器並無阻塞或腐蝕的困擾。 (b) 當煙道氣溫低於250 °F時，NH3會與HCl反應形成NH4Cl，造成煙囪不透光率增加的不良結果。 選擇性觸媒脫硝反應技術 反應式 – 此法是以NH3為還原劑，經過觸媒將NOx還原為N2，其主要反應如下: \\(\\ce{4NO +4NH3 + O2 &lt;=&gt; 4N2 +6H2O}\\) \\(\\ce{2NO2 +4NH3 + O2 &lt;=&gt; 3N2 +6H2O}\\) 由於NOx中NO含量達90~95%，因此第一個反應最重要，所以NH3/NOX比值應保持在1左右。由於O2是必要的，因此至少要維持3%以上。為了解反應情況，通常須測量反應後廢氣中NH3的含量，稱為氨溢出量(Ammonia Slipage)，其控制量約為3 ppm。 注意事項 – 常用之觸媒為TiO2-V2O5型，其反應溫度約為300~750 °F，廢氣中之硫化物、鉀、砷容易使觸媒中毒，在操作上須注意: 盡量避免硫酸銨鹽或硫酸氫鹽的產生。 (2)鉀會吸附在V2O5觸媒表面上，須定期以80 °C熱水清洗再生(1 hr)，以恢復觸媒活性 (3)若廢氣中含有砷，觸媒活性在1000小時操作時間內，即可能衰退50%以上。 如果使用重質燃油或固體燃料，廢氣中含有較多的灰分，易造成觸媒床阻塞，故需在反應器進口增設靜電除塵設備(EP)。使用輕質油料或燃料氣，則較無灰分的問題，不必再裝置除塵設備。(裝置參考圖6.11) 脫硝反應裝置的設計考慮因素有: (1)氣體流量 (2)氣體溫度 (3)氣體成分: 水蒸汽百分比、O2百分比、NO/NO2的量、SO2及其他會造成觸媒活性降低之抑制劑含量 (4)排放氣體預期NOx濃度及NH3溢出量 (5)壓降 (6) 若欲在現有工廠加裝時，需考慮修改導管方向與尺寸。 "],["w13_0517-席老師.html", "Chapter 11 W13_0517 （席老師） 11.1 cyclone 旋風集塵器 11.2 wet scrabber 濕式洗滌 11.3 baghouse (fabric filter) 袋式集塵器 11.4

小颗粒比较不容易带电，需要大的电压。 不同區塊（不同去除階段）可以設爲不同的電壓，以達到整體的去除效率最佳化 可以依序使用高电压、低电压，以便首先去除小颗粒，再去除大颗粒。也可以反之。（依据设计理念不同） 13.1 近期的熱門的ESP的設計類型： cylindrical esp 蜂巢狀 其實早就有，但是以前不怎麽用 濕式的(WESP) 會要噴水，噴水的好處：和濕式洗滌塔類似，可以讓小顆粒遇水變成大顆粒較容易去除。 做空氣污染防制，非必要，不用水。因爲如果用水，空氣污染就變成水污染了，還要再做水處理。 傳統的防制設備流程： -&gt;[ESP/BH]-&gt;[FGD]-&gt;[Stack] BH: Bag House FGD: 加堿，去除二氧化硫 SO_x Stack: 烟囪，排出去 [WESP]常會被裝在[FGD]的正上方，氣體從下向上。 工廠通常沒有額外的地方 考慮顆粒的電阻係數 e.g.燃燒不完全所產生的【未燃碳】，電阻係數高，即很難帶電，即很難去除。需要很高的電壓，使他帶電，但是會很難grounded，帶負電的顆粒附著在集塵板，不掉下來。BACK CORONA，逆電，會減少去除效率。 增加堿金屬，黏性高，附著在顆粒表面，使得顆粒的電阻降低。 燃燒太完全，電阻係數低，很難帶電，需要很高的電壓 13.2 計算 ppm by volumn ppm by mass 台灣大多數法規常用ppm，針對 volumn to volumn 美國，用mass/m^3 要轉換 13.2.1 標準狀態（英語：standard temperature and pressure, STP，標準溫度與標準壓力） STP：25°C, 1 atm

校正順序：溫度氣壓、水分、CO2、O3 CO2矯正：燃燒系統要校正 CO2，台灣的法規不太做，几乎沒有二氧化碳校正 氧氣校正最重要，美國的校正標準：7%，台灣的校正標準：6% 燃燒系統，即便過氧燃燒，如果采樣的氣體，氧含量幾乎等於外界濃度： 故意稀釋 管綫破洞 稀釋也不怕，就用氧氣校正標準去校正！ 戴奧辛： 0.1 雖然標準很低，但是沒有氧氣校正。如果有氧氣校正，台灣的大部分污染源（鍋爐、焚化厰）都會超標！（燃燒源往往是過氧燃燒，廢棄含氧量約20%），所以主管機關原本想要加入氧氣校正，卻無法落實，怕會太大影響 以體積作爲濃度基準，則體積比例不會隨溫度改變。 SO_2 200ppm 但若以質量作爲濃度基準，則質量/體積之比例會隨溫度改變！ 在訂定法規的時候，要考慮其對應的校正 13.3 下禮拜期末考
